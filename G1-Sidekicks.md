Note: this class is intended for NPC sidekicks.

- **Bonus Proficiencies**

1st-level Spellcaster feature 

The sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in two skills of your choice from the following list: Arcana, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Performance, Persuasion, and Religion.

The sidekick gains proficiency with light armor, and if it is a humanoid or has a simple or martial weapon in its stat block, it also gains proficiency with all simple weapons.

- **Medical Exploits**

As a medic, you gain exploits you can use to aid allies or hinder enemies. Mechanically, these are identical to spells. Exploits require both the use of your hands and appropri- ate materials to perform. Unlike spells, medical exploits require neither contemplation nor studying each morning; you regain the use of them each day without effort. You do not need to choose which exploits to prepare ahead of time. You can employ any exploit on the list of a level that you can use.

At 1st level, you also know two medical applications of your choice from the medical application list. These are at- will abilities you can use as long as you have the necessary materials and action to perform them. You learn additional applications of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the medical applications column of the medic table. The medic table shows how many slots you have to use your exploits of 1st level and higher. To enact one of these exploits, you must expend a slot of the exploit’s level or higher. You regain all expended exploit slots when you fin- ish a long rest.

When you become a medic, select either your Wisdom or Intelligence as your medic ability. It is used when set- ting the saving throw DC for a medical application you use and when making an attack roll with one. If selecting Intel- ligence, the Wisdom (Medicine) skill can be replaced with Intelligence (Medicine).

Exploit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier Exploit attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier

Kits. Many exploits and applications require the use of either a medical kit or a biochemistry kit. A medical kit has enough supplies for 50 actions, while the biochemistry kit has enough for 10 actions. This is regardless of how many targets are af- fected by said action

- **Medical Expertise**: Beginning at 3rd level, the sidekick gains an expertise dice for Wisdom (Medicine). It can raise D8s to D10's and D10' to D12's with this feature
