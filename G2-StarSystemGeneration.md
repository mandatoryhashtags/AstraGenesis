## Star System Generation

It is assumed you are generating Subsectors, and Sectors according to what is outlined in Chapter 13. 

So a Subsector is a 10x8 grid with 80 possible Hexes. 

Glossary of Galactic Terms:

- 1.0 Galactic Standard AU = 150,000,000 km
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Mass = 5.9E+24 kg
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Diameter = 12,467 km
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Gravity = 9.8m/s2 (Escape velocity (km/s) = 11.186)
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Year = 365.25 Galactic Standard days
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Day = 24 Galactic Standard hours
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Hour = 60 Galactic Standard minutes
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Minute = 60 Galactic Standard seconds
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Radiation Exposure = 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year.
- 1.0 Galactic Standard Atmospheric Pressure = 1.033 kg/m3



### Subsector Politics

The first step is to determine who is active in this SubSector.

| D100  | # of Factions |
| ----- | ------------- |
| 01-50 | Two           |
| 51-75 | Three         |
| 76-99 | Four          |
| 100   | Five          |

Always assume that the UTE and the Council are at the least Active in the SubSector this is represented by the 50% chance that there are only two factions operating in the Subsector. If it is 3+ then it will be determined by you the GM if they are entirely new Factions, a Megacorporation, Pirates, or a new advanced species. If it is a new species and you want to add some randomness to this determination use this Tag generator.

| D10 | Tag           |
| --- | ------------- |
| 1   | War           |
| 2   | Factions      |
| 3   | Peacekeepers  |
| 4   | Slaves        |
| 5   | Expansionists |
| 6   | Industrialist |
| 7   | Spacefarers   |
| 8   | Lifegivers    |
| 9   | Allied        |
| 10  | Private       |


- **War**:. The species is at war with another randomly selected species. Both have warships and will attack one another on site. You can assume the war has been going on for D20 years, but if you roll a 20, roll D100 to see how many years the war has raged! You should consider how this war has affected each system of the region.

- **Factions**:. This species has allied with one of the Galactic factions. D100, <50 UTE, >50 Council.

- **Peacekeepers**:. The species is crucial to the other species’ interaction. Perhaps it serves as the interstellar bankers of the sector, or maybe enforces peace through superior technology or firepower. Maybe it’s the most advanced of the species technologically, or politically, or economically, but uses those superiorities to enforce peace. The species maintains neutrality while keeping this peace, or is that neutrality a ruse?

- **Slaves**:. The species used to be (or still is?) a slave race to another randomly-selected species. It may harbor intolerance for the slavers, or this may serve only as a backdrop to their interactions rather than a driver of it. This could create a primary moral and political conflict within the sector that touches all species.

- **Expansionists**:. The species is known as expansionist imperialists. It strives to bring more and more worlds into its political fold. It may do this through war, financial acquisition, political negotiation, or whatever… but it’s not going to be sated until it governs the entire sector.

- **Industrialists**:. The species runs a megacorporation. Or the Species is run by a Corporation. Are they here for resources? Is there more than one? Each corporation might be purists who only consist of this species, or may be open to inclusion of the usefulness of other species. Consider how this impacts the sector. Do these corporations drive the politics of the entire sector with their corporate agendas and interactions?

- **Spacefarers**:. The species has been starfaring the longest in this sector and still has technological superiority. It may be a benevolent species who uplifted the other species to be starfaring, or may have simply contacted them and served as mentors and friends and brought spacefaring technology to them. Are they the only species in the sector with Jump Drive Tech?

- **Lifegivers**:. The species created one of the other randomly-selected species, either through genetic engineering or application of technology and cyberware. The relationship between the two can be subservient/dependent or completely equal/friendly. It could also be the source of ancestral gratitude or resentment. Does the lifegiving species consider itself gods? Does it see the other species’ properties and starships as extensions of its own? Or is it just backdrop to the story, barely affecting species interactions?

- **Allied**:. The species has a diplomatic alliance with another randomly-selected species that allows the two to share achievements, resources, and innovations freely. Of course, this alliance may come with a price to one or both sides. How do other species feel about this alliance?

- **Private**:. The species minds its own business and tends not to interact with others


### Subsector Nebulas
| D100  | Nebula Present    |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 01-50 | No Nebula Present |
| 51-60 | 1 Nebula Present  |
| 61-70 | 2 Neubla Present  |
| 71-80 | 3 Nebula Present  |
| 81-90 | 4 Nebula Present  |
| 91-99 | 5 Nebula Present  |
| 100   | D8 Nebula Present |

Once you know how many Nebula, if any are present. 

Roll D10 and then D8 for each one and mark the Hex, if you get the same Hex twice move to the next Nebula. That tells you the **center** of the nebula

Then each hex which touches that center has a 5 in 10 chance of also being a nebula space. Place hash lines or color in nebula hexes in some way. If you want your nebula to be more than just simple decoration in your sector, 

Then determine what kind of Nebula each one is.

| D10 | Nebula Characteristic          |
| --- | ------------------------------ |
| 1   | Navigational Hazard            |
| 2   | Nova Drive Intake Hazard       |
| 3   | Wormhole Hazard                |
| 4   | Communication Blindness Hazard |
| 5   | Shield Integrity Hazard        |
| 6   | Sensor Blindness Hazard        |
| 7   | Laser Failure Hazard           |
| 8   | Neurological Hazard            |
| 9   | EMP Hazard                     |
| 10  | Not Really a Nebula            |

- **Navigational Hazard**. Interferes with navigational equipment. Cannot be navigated using standard astrogation equipment. A ship traveling at FTL speeds will enter a hex containing this nebula fine, but must use the grenade bounce table found in the combat section of the Game Guidelines Chapter to determine how it exits that hex. Yes, it might exit back the way it came.

- **Jump Drive Hazard**. This nebula seeps into a Jump Drive's intakes and mucks with its ability to maintain or generate its Jump Field effects. Each hex travelled through has a 5 in 10 chance to stall the drive, requiring D6 days of being stranded in the nebula while systems are purged and the drive system is reset and recalibrated

- **Wormhole Hazard**. Random wormholes appear and disappear within the nebula. Each hex traveled through has a 10% chance to send your ship to a random location in the sector. (Use D10/D8 to determine where the ship ends up!) Once sent in this manner, the ship’s drives need an refit and will be at half Jump Rating and Sublight speeds until that refit is performed.

- **Communication Blindness Hazard**. The nebula interferes with subspace, radio frequency, and even laser point-to-point communication systems. Ships in this nebula can neither receive nor send subspace messages.

- **Shield Integrity Hazard**. The nebula interferes with Shield generators. Shields simply won’t function in this nebula. Getting into a star fight within this nebula can be dangerous… don’t try it unless you have a really good pilot and a highly maneuverable ship!

- **Sensor Blindness Hazard**. The nebula interferes with Sensors. Ships are blind. They cannot see the presence of other ships or stellar objects while in the nebula except when extremely close, creating collision risks. Anyone who moves through a hex at at greater than half velocities has a 10% chance to collide with an asteroid, debris, or rogue planetoid, causing damage as if rammed by a huge frame starship (7D10x10 HP).

- **Energy Weapon Failure Hazard**. The nebula diffuses energy weapons. They will fire (and drain energy from capacitors), but they lose effectiveness dramatically. Each hex of range the weapon loses D10 of its effectiveness. Don’t bother trying to use energy weapons here unless at point blank range.

- **Neurological Hazard**. Interferes with brainwave activity, causing psychological instability or even outright violent rage among the crew of any ship that spends a full day here. Permanent insanity can result from spending too much time here.

- **EMP Hazard**. Interferes with magnetic fields created by electronic power sources. Each hex traveled through has a 2 in 10 chance to shut down and deplete all power sources for droids, computers, weapons, ship systems, etc. This leaves the ship dead and adrift in the nebula and in need of rescue… and a lot of power cells and devices needing replacement.

- **Not Really a Nebula**. This isn’t a nebula… it’s actually a densely-populated vast area full of large asteroids and debris. Navigating it is slow and cumbersome but safe as long as speeds are kept sub-light. It could even be a minefield left over from a very old war!


### System Population
Roll 1D20 + 20 to get a number of Systems.

Roll D10/D8 for each one and place it, if you get the same grid twice either reroll or discard.

You now have how many Systems you need to create and can move on to creating the GSP for each one below. 

### GSP

It is a series of numbers and letters.

0-9, A-Z where 1+ is valid and 0 is a null or empty value.

000 0000  0000  000000000 0

123-456-789A-BCDEFGHIJK-

The first 7 characters are Address data which helps starships locate the exact location of the starsystem in the galaxy.

The next 15 characters are Stellar Data. Or the GSP (Galactic System Profile)

- Address Codes
1. Domain of system 1-Z
2. Sector of system 1-4
3. Subsector of system 1-F (inside the sector)
4. Coordinate 1 in Subsector

| 13-17 | Binary          |
| 18-19 | Trinary         |
| 20    | Quadrinary      |

> Jack is creating a SubSector
> He rolls an 11 and gets a Single Star

#### 2. Primary Star Type

| D100  | Class | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   | 9   |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 65-74 | G     | 1.1  | 1    | 1    | 1    | .9  | .9  | .9  | .9  | .8  | .8  |
| 75-84 | F     | 1.6  | 1.6  | 1.5  | 1.5  | 1.4 | 1.4 | 1.3 | 1.3 | 1.2 | 1.1 |
| 85-94 | A     | 2.9  | 2.7  | 2.5  | 2.4  | 2.1 | 1.9 | 1.8 | 1.8 | 1.8 | 1.7 |
| 95-98 | B     | 17.5 | 14.2 | 10.9 | 7.6  | 6.7 | 5.9 | 5.2 | 4.5 | 3.8 | 3.4 |
| 99    | O     | 100  | 97.5 | 95   | 92.5 | 90  | 60  | 37  | 30  | 23  | 20  |


1. Roll D100 to determine star Class
2. Then roll a D10 to determine progression (age) 0-9.
3. Then lookup that class, with that progession to get the Base Mass

> Continuing with Jack, he rolled a 38 and got a M class star, then a 6 for Progression it would have a base mass of .3


#### 3. Luminosity 

| D100  | Luminosity | GSP Code | Classification | M     | K     | G    | F    | A    | B    | O    |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- | ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 00-14 | I          | 1        | Supergiant     | x37.4 | x11.1 | x5.7 | x6.1 | x5.0 | x3.1 | x1.8 |
| 15-29 | II         | 2        | Bright Giant   | x25.3 | x5.9  | x2.7 | x4.4 | x3.6 | x2.4 | x1.6 |
| 30-44 | III        | 3        | Giant          | x17.1 | x4.2  | x2.2 | x3.3 | x2.8 | x2.0 | x1.4 |
| 45-59 | IV         | 4        | Sub-Giant      | x9.1  | x2.6  | x1.6 | x2.1 | x1.9 | x1.5 | x1.2 |
| 60-84 | V          | 5        | Main Sequence  | x1    | x1    | x1   | x1   | x1   | x1   | x1   |
| 85-99 | VI         | 6        | Sub-Dwarf      | x.5   | x.7   | x.9  | x.8  | x.7  | x.5  | x.3  |

1. Roll D100 to get the Luminosity code
2. Then lookup the Star Class with the luminosity code you got and multiple the value by the base mass value to get the final mass

> Continuing with Jack he rolled a 45 on Luminosity so it is a Code IV Sub-Giant so he needs to multiply .3 with 9.1 (.3 * 9.1) and get the total mass of 2.73 this will be used later and it goes in the GSP
> So Jack now has the Number of Stars (1), the Primary Star Type (M), The progession of the star (6), the luminosity of the star III (3) and the mass of the star (2.73)
> Giving him GSP values of 1M632.73 so far

You can look up how bright the star is (luminosity) its Diameter and Temperature in Kelvin in the Appendix. It is just detail and not required to get the GSP.

### Zones
Every star has 10 Zones.

1. Near
2. Inner
3. Habitable
4. Outer 1
5. Outer 2
6. Outer 3
7. Far 1
8. Far 2
9. Far 3
10. Far 4

Each Zone tends to have an Object in it. The Stellar Mass of the Star will determine the range with which each zone is. If you do not care for your system it is not tat important. For normal Astra Genesis Sublight is 1 AU/10 minutes of Sublight time. So it can be important. 

| Stellar Mass | 1             | 2             | 3             | 4              | 5               | 6               | 7                | 8                 | 9                 | 10                  |

> Continuing with Jack he has a Mass of 2.73 so Zone 1 he decides 1 AU's, Zone 2 is 3 AU's, Zone 3 is 5 AU's, Zone 4 is 10 AU's, Zone 5 is 20 AU's, Zone 6 is 40 AU's, Zone 7 is 75 AU's, Zone 8 is 150 AU's, Zone 9 is 300 AU's and Zone 10 is 500 AU's. Jack likes nice round numbers. 

> Setting Designer I usually just pick something dead center.

### Planetary Data
In this step, you will be defining some basic details about each orbital object: gravity, diameter, mass, number of moons, whether or not planetary rings are present, and some optional additional details if you wish. If you are creating a world that needs to support life, make sure you refer to the Planet Generation system later in this chapter.

#### ASTEROID BELT
These tables are used to determine the size, population density, and types of asteroids found in the belt. Note that these tables are for representative purposes only. At any given point in an asteroid belt, larger or smaller asteroids can exist as well as different density of population. Use your imagination. A particularly large asteroid might be treated as a rogue Dwarf Planetoid.

| 9-0 | Very Dense                        |

#### DWARF PLANETOID
Dwarf planets are typically smaller than terrestrial planets, do not have secondary atmospheres and have not cleared their orbital path of all other bodies. Sometimes, dwarf planets can be found as moons orbiting larger planets (especially large gas giants) and in these cases, if conditions are right, may be habitable.

#### Jovians
Jovian planets are large planets that are not primarily composed of silicates or other solid matter and lack a clearly defined surface. They are subdivided into two categories, gas giants and ice giants. Gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium while ice giants are mostly composed of water, ammonia and methane.

##### JOVIAN: ICE
Ice Jovians are large planets primarily composed of water, ammonia, and methane. Although they have a solid core, they lack a clearly defined surface. Their proportion of hydrogen and helium is lower than gas giants due to their greater distance from the star. Ice giants located in zone 1 of a star system should be treated as Jovian: Gas instead.

GSP Code I

##### JOVIAN: GAS
Gas giants are primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, and have a solid core, but lack a clearly defined surface. A great benefit to spaceships in this game is that they can deploy fuel scoops to gather gases from gas Jovians. Since gas giants are somewhat abundant, these naturally-occurring fuel sources help a thriving interstellar community.

##### JOVIAN DETAILS
You can roll on the following tables to specify the fuel rating and main and trace gasses present in a Jovian Gas, as well as the makeup of its core. These tables are certainly not scientific. You don’t have to use these tables, as they won’t likely have any effect on gameplay. They look great on a player hand-out, however! Like many of the tables in this chapter, these tables are not scientifically derived. They were constructed by a lot of internet searching and result compilation, and therefore might have some science in their fiction and will work great in a game handout. If you decide to roll on no other tables on this page, at least consider rolling for the Jovian Fuel Rating. Players needing free fuel as they fly around the galaxy will need to know if they can stop here. In Astra Genesis Helium-3 is the primary fuel source used by Sublight engines and Reactors, it can be derived from regular Helium. If you are curious in the real world Tritium decays into Helium-3, and Tritium (Hydrogen-3) comes from neutron activation of Lithium-6 making Hydrogen-3. We skip all of that and just assume the advanced reactors can convert Hydrogen into Hydrogen-3 and then into Helium-3 so most Jovians can provide fuel.

#### TERRESTRIAL PLANET
Terrestrial planets have roughly the same structure: a central metallic core (mostly iron) with a surrounding silicate mantle. These planets have canyons, craters, mountains and volcanoes. Terrestrial planets possess secondary atmospheres unlike Jovian (gas giants) which possess primary atmospheres. Terrestrial planets are also called “rocky planets”.

GSP Code T

#### HABITABILITY
A dwarf planetoid or terrestrial planet in the habitable zone might be suitable for habitation. A Jovian in the inner, habitable, or outer zones (Zones 2, 3, or 4) could have a moon with habitable properties. Asteroids and the surface of Jovians cannot be habitable. Asteroids have only trace gravities and normally no atmosphere, while Jovians lack a clearly defined surface.

GSP Code H

##### Can the planet support life?
⬢ It is a terrestrial planet, dwarf planetoid, or moon. Jovians and asteroids are not suitable. Jovians lack a proper surface, and asteroids are too small.

⬢ It is located in the Inner, Habitable, or Outer zone of a star system. The Near and Far zones are too close or too far to be suitable.

⬢ It has gravity in the range of 0.5g to 1.5g. While higher or lower gravity might support some kind of life, it cannot support the type of life played by character species in the 'Verse.

⬢ It has no atmospheric pressure hazard at least somewhere on the planet (though it is possible that some areas may have such pressure hazards).

⬢ It has no radiation hazard at least somewhere on the planet (though it is possible that some areas may have such radiation hazards).

⬢ It has some areas with no atmospheric or hydrospheric toxicity hazards (though it is possible that some areas may possess such atmospheric or hydrospheric hazards).

⬢ It has some areas with no temperature hazard (though it is possible that some regions could have such temperature hazards).

#### MOONS
> Setting Designer
> Some of these Jovians can have over 90 moons. **Do not roll all of these moons**
> If the Jovian is in one of the habitable zones, I will roll the size, and gravity. If it has between .5g and 1.5g I will note it down, otherwise a moon is just a moon.
> It has to be Large or Huge.
> If the planet has a reasonable number of moons 8 or less I will tend to roll them and check for resources as my players tend to sell mining rights a lot.

If a Moon is habitable it changes that Zone code to H.

#### Features and Tags
It wouldn’t be that fun for player characters to investigate a star system and find nothing but a bunch of asteroids, planetoids, and Jovians. They want to find something; that’s why they’re out here.

This table provides an imagination outlet for GMs. Feel free to create your own or ignore this table completely. There are many things that might be found in a star system, but if every unexplored star system contains incredible mysteries, players will begin to expect it.

When a new star system is first explored, roll on this table to determine what is found. If you really want there to be something unusual, just choose an item from the list below.

Optionally as the GM if you want the system to be interesting or have something to say about it roll for 2 tags on the SYSTEM TAGS table at the end of this chapter. Also at the end of this Chapter is a table of World Tags meant to compose a couple of sentences about a world and what makes it interesting use those if you desire.

- Precursor Artifact: A precursor device floats in space. Possibilities are mines, ships, hulks, probes, etc. It may be rigged to detonate or repair itself, and might hold information about the race that left it. Definitely TL 16

- Precursor Ruins: Ruins and remnants of a precuroser civilization that predates current cultures. There could be TL 16+ artifacts The remnants may be on a planet or moon.

- Ancient Robot: A previous civilization left a robot behind, which has picked up some very strange and intriguing habits.

- Ancient Ruins: Ruins and remnants of an ancient civilization that predates current cultures. The remnants may be on a planet or moon.

- Artificial Moon: The moon has been drastically altered or manufactured by unknown beings. There is a 10% chance this is a Dyson moon. (A Dyson sphere has a hollow center and may be able to be entered at the poles.)

- Comet(s): One or more comets are trapped in the gravity of this star system and engages in a very wide many-decade-long elliptical orbit.

- Cross-planar Orbit: Usually, orbital objects orbit a star in a more-or-less flat plane. In this star system, one of the planets doesn’t follow the same plane as the others. Perhaps it was added later to the star system after drifting in as a rogue body.

- Deep Space Lifeform: Some unknown creature, able to live in deep-space without the need for life support, is found. It may live on a planet or a moon, and may not be hostile.

- Depleted Resources: Evidence of precious resources exists all over this star system, but evidence also exists of mining by some past culture. Perhaps old mining technology was left behind?

- Derelict Ship: A spacecraft in deep space. Possibilities include a ship abandoned after a pirate attack, a lost STL (slow-than-light) ship configured as for colonization, research, or as a probe. It may have smaller ships onboard that the characters might learn how to operate.

- Doomsday Planet: A rogue world passes by every (D00x10) years. It is calculated that in (D00x100) years, it will collide with the either the planet or its moon, either of which will be disastrous.

- Electromagnetic Atmospheric Conditions: The planet has atmospheric reactions to the presence of one or more of its moons. As the moon streaks across the sky, the atmosphere produces aurora borealis-like light shows.

- Generations-old Castaways: A starship crashed here, long ago. The descendants of those castaways live here today. A culture has formed over the generations that differs dramatically from the culture of those who originally crashed. It may be organized, but its technology is outdated or limited. They may even be primitive!

- Glowing Moon: Natural photo-luminescent aluminate minerals are present on one of this world’s moon’s surfaces. It glows in the dark rather than just reflecting light, never letting the world see complete darkness.

- Micro Black Hole: This entire star system revolves around a micro black hole (technically, a quantum mechanical black hole). It has an incredible mass, but the distance is sufficient that this star’s system orbits it rather than being sucked in. There are theories about how to use such a stellar phenomenon as a perpetual power source.

- Micro Pulsar: The primary star (or a companion) is a rapidly rotating failing neutron star giving off pulses of multiple wavelengths. No wireless signal-based technology (scanners, subspace communicators, etc.) will function in this system.

- Mine Field: This star system has an asteroid field filled with crystals with such a high surface stress that even getting too close to one makes it explode. Treat as a naturally occurring mine field.

- Ringed Moon: The moon collided with a large meteor several thousand years ago. The debris from it has been caught by the mass of the moon and looks like a ring when viewed from the planet’s surface. The debris may be of value (50% chance to roll on the precious resource table).

- Unstable Planet: One of the planets has something seriously wrong with it. It seems okay on initial inspection, but a careful scan will reveal its days are numbered (D00 days when found, to be exact). There is no way to stabilize it.

- Water Reservoir: A cloud of pure water gas orbits the star at its FTL horizon. It is so thick that the star is concealed from view. The water can be captured with scoops and delivered to space stations or outposts with ease.

- Temporal Anomaly: Time flows differently in this star system. Depending on your proximity to the star, you may experience time passing at different rates. Explorers may need to adjust their clocks to navigate effectively.

- Exotic Gas Giant: One of the gas giants in this system has a unique atmosphere filled with exotic gases. Scientists and researchers are eager to study it, but the extreme conditions make it a dangerous endeavor.

- Solar Flare Surges: The star in this system is known for frequent and intense solar flare surges. These surges can disrupt communications and electronics, posing challenges to navigation and communication.

- Quantum Crystal Formation: Unexplained crystal formations can be found on a remote moon in this system. These crystals exhibit strange quantum properties that defy known science. They're highly sought after by researchers and collectors.

- Living Starship: An enormous, sentient starship roams this star system. It's a bio-engineered entity, possibly abandoned by its creators, and it may have its own mysterious agenda.

- Magnetic Anomaly: A powerful magnetic anomaly affects navigation within this star system. Ships' compasses go haywire, making it difficult to maintain course. Navigating this system requires skill and specialized equipment.

- Mysterious Signals: Signals of unknown origin periodically emanate from the system's outer reaches. They are indecipherable, sparking speculation about their source and purpose.

- Frozen Civilization: A once-thriving civilization on a distant planet has been mysteriously frozen in time. Explorers can observe the city frozen mid-activity, offering glimpses into the past. The cause remains a mystery.

- Living Nebula: A massive, sentient nebula drifts through this star system. It communicates through electromagnetic waves and appears to be a living entity. Its motives and origins are unknown.

- Space-time Rift: A rift in space-time exists at the system's edge. Ships that enter risk encountering temporal anomalies, alternate dimensions, or even time travel. It's a perilous but potentially rewarding venture.

- Subspace Beacon: An ancient subspace beacon orbits one of the planets. It emits a signal that attracts explorers seeking its secrets. Its purpose and the knowledge it holds are coveted by many.

- Phantom Pirates: Legends tell of ghostly pirate ships that raid passing vessels in this system. Some believe they're the remnants of long-dead pirates, while others suspect a more supernatural explanation.

- Silicon-based Lifeforms: Unusual silicon-based lifeforms inhabit one of the system's moons. They've developed complex societies and possess unique technology. Scientists are eager to study their biology and culture.

- Cryogenic Ship Graveyard: A vast graveyard of cryogenically frozen starships exists in orbit around a barren planet. The ships are relics of a forgotten war, and their secrets are buried in their frozen interiors.

- Stellar Observatory: An ancient observatory built around the star is filled with advanced astronomical instruments. It's said to hold secrets about the cosmos and the star's past.

- Sentient Asteroid: A large asteroid in the system exhibits signs of sentience. It responds to attempts at communication and may even provide cryptic information about the universe.

- Temporal Dilation Zone: A region of space within the system experiences extreme temporal dilation. Time passes much slower or faster here, depending on your location. It's a potential resource for time-related research.

- Space-faring Pirates: A notorious pirate fleet operates from a hidden base within this system. They're known for daring heists and eluding authorities. The challenge is either to join them or bring them to justice.

- Quantum Anomaly Nexus: This system contains a nexus of quantum anomalies, creating unpredictable effects. Explorers may encounter parallel versions of themselves or experience time loops.

- Crystal Forest: A moon is covered in towering crystal structures that emit eerie, harmonious sounds when the wind blows through them. The crystals are sought after for their unique properties.

Certainly! Here are 20 additional unique system features and their descriptions:

- Nebula Nexus: Several nebulae in this star system converge at a central point, creating a breathtaking display of swirling colors and cosmic phenomena. Navigating through these nebulae requires advanced sensors and navigation skills.

- Cosmic Stormfront: A perpetual stormfront of charged particles and energy rages between two planets in the system. It poses a formidable challenge to spacecraft attempting to traverse it, with lightning storms and magnetic interference.

- Quantum Garden: On a remote moon, a garden of quantum-entangled flora flourishes. These plants have unique properties, such as instant growth or telepathic communication with those who touch them. They are highly sought after for scientific study.

- Phantom Anomalies: Mysterious spatial anomalies occasionally materialize, creating temporary wormholes or teleporting ships to unknown locations within the system. Their origin and behavior remain enigmatic.

- Timeless Observatory: An ancient observatory exists on a small asteroid within the system. It appears to be unaffected by the passage of time and contains advanced astronomical knowledge. It may hold clues to the cosmos' secrets.

- Gravity Forge: A planet-sized artificial construct generates variable gravity fields. Visitors can experience different gravity levels by moving within the construct. It's a popular destination for tourists and researchers alike.

- Hyperspace Resonance: An unusual resonance within the system enhances the efficiency of ships' hyperspace drives, allowing for faster-than-usual travel. The phenomenon attracts traders and travelers from across the galaxy.

- Nebular Sirens: Nebulae in this system emit harmonic frequencies that affect sentient beings' emotions and thoughts. Pilots must resist the mesmerizing effects to navigate safely.




### Jump Distance
To engage a Jump Drive a ship has to be in Zone 4 or further this is why in Astra Genesis we note how many AU's something is away. There are exceptions to this such as an Emergency Jump which can occur in other zones but it is risky because there is a chance it can damage the Jump Drive.

### Creating Planets/Moons
For each Terrestrial planet, dwarf planetoid or Moon (if you so desire) determine its Gravity, Diameter, Mass, Moons, and Rings. If it has between .5G and 1.5G while residing in Zonez 2-6 it could be habitable it makes sense to then determine it's further details. If you have decided the planet is Habitable regardless and *is* habited roll a GWP for it under that section. If it is not Habited you should roll the following data.


#### 1. Hydrospheric Data
Each planet has a different biosphere that is a result of the percentages of water. The planet’s proximity to the star might affect the amount of water that is present in ice, liquid, and/or vapor form. Lower percentages of water might negatively affect a planet’s radiation levels.

##### AMOUNT OF WATER PRESENT
Roll D100 to determine the total amount of water present on this planet. This should be read as a percentage of the overall surface of the planet. For instance, a planet’s surface might be 46% water.

##### REGION EFFECT CONSIDERATIONS
Depending on the regional zone the planet resides in, you might consider the following notes to see how water might be configured on your planet.

- Inner Zone: In this region, most water is likely below the crust and/or locked in the form of ice at the caps. It’s also possible for a moon in this zone to be shielded by its Jovian for enough time to make it temperate enough to hold liquid water.

- Habitable Zone: Some of the water will be locked in ice at the poles while the rest is distributed into oceans, lakes, rivers, groundwater, etc. This is the optimal zone for water to exist as a liquid.

- Outer Zone: Half the water is probably locked into the caps or covering the landscape in the form of ice. If you’re creating a moon in this region, its Jovian may be churning out enough heat to make the moon temperate enough to keep water liquid.

> Continuing with Jack he has 4 moons that might have life to check
> Moon 1: .51G, .66 Mass, 38% Hydrosphere
> Moon 2: .56G, .151 Mass, 28% Hydrosphere
> Moon 3: .86G, .130 Mass, 78% Hydrosphere
> Moon 4: 1.28G, .25 Mass, 31% Hydrosphere

#### 2. Atmospheric Pressure
This is the force exerted against a surface by the weight of the atmosphere. Thin atmospheres are barely noticeable while dense atmospheres require special equipment to withstand the pressure. Think of it as diving deep into the water, the further you go the more pressure you feel on your skin. Atmospheric pressure is determined by a planet’s Mass and by some randomization:

| Mass           | D10 1-2   | D10 3-8    | D10 9-0    |
| -------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Less than 0.3  | Very Thin | Very Thin  | Thin       |
| .3 to .75      | Very Thin | Thin       | Moderate   |
| .76 to 1.25    | Thin      | Moderate   | Dense      |
| 1.26 to 10     | Moderate  | Dense      | Very Dense |
| Higher than 10 | Dense     | Very Dense | Very Dense |

- **Very Thin**: Anyone exposed to these types atmospheres will find it very difficult to breath and must wear vacsuits or spacesuits with an oxygen supply. Atmospheric pressure is from negligible/vacuum up to .2 Galactic Standard Pressures.
  - Use (1d100 * 0.02).
  - If a character finds himself in this environment without a vacsuit or spacesuit to equalize pressure, he’ll suffer from suffocation.
  - If the pressure is .05 or less, characters in this environment are Poisoned and Suffocating.
  - Life cannot exist in planets with Very Thin atmospheric pressure.
- **Thin**: Breathing is difficult but not impossible. Characters will have a difficult time maintaining any extracurricular activity for more than a few minutes. Atmospheric pressure is between 0.3 and 0.5 Galactic Standard Pressure.
  - Use (1d10/50+0.3).
  - If a character finds himself in the thin environment without breathing assistance, he suffers from Poisoned (Disadvantage to all rolls).
  - If pressure is below 0.35 times the Galactic Standard Pressure, characters would be Poisoned and takes damage (that is, D6 damage per hour of exposure and hourly rate of travel divided by two).
  - Life can exist on worlds with thin atmospheric pressure.
- **Moderate**: Standard atmospheres that do not require any special gear to breath. Atmospheric pressure is between 0.6 and 1.5 Galactic Standard Pressure.
  - Use (1d10+5)/10.
  - Life can exist on worlds with Moderate atmospheric pressure.
- **Dense**: Breathing is difficult but not impossible. Characters will have a difficult time maintaining any extracurricular activity for more than a few minutes. Atmospheric pressure is between 1.6 and 16 times the Galactic Standard Pressure.
  - Use (1d100 x .16).
  - If a character finds himself in the dense environment without breathing assistance, he suffers from Poisoned (Disadvantage to all rolls)..
  - If pressure is above 12 times the Galactic Standard Pressure, characters would be Poisoned and takes damage (that is, D6 damage per hour of exposure and hourly rate of travel divided by two)
  - Life can exist on worlds with Dense atmospheric pressure.
- **Very Dense**: Anyone exposed to these types atmospheres will find it very difficult to breath and must wear vacsuits or spacesuits with an oxygen supply. Atmospheric pressure is between 16 and 160 times the Galactic Standard Pressure.
  - Use (1d100 x 16).
  - If a character finds himself in this environment without a vacsuit or spacesuit to equalize pressure, he’ll suffer from suffocation.
  - If the pressure is 100 or more, characters in this environment are Poisoned and Suffocating.
  - Life cannot exist in planets with Very Dense atmospheric pressure.

| Pressure   | Vac Suit Required | Galactic Standard Pressure | Effect                                             |

#### 3. Radiation Level
Radiation can be deadly to complex and simple life forms alike, but most life can tolerate some amount of it.

Proximity to the planet’s star determines base radiation exposure, but the planet can vary this dramatically (the planet’s core can generate radiation, while its atmospheric density – if it contains enough water – might act to reduce radiation exposure on the planet’s surface).

To determine radiation level, start with the planet’s proximity to the star use the Zone. Use the Percentage of Liquid to cross reference against the atmospheric pressure column.


| Zone      | % Liquid | Very Thin | Thin   | Moderate | Dense  | Very Dense |
| --------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
| Near      | 01-25    | Deadly    | Deadly | Deadly   | Severe | Minor      |
| Near      | 26-75    | Deadly    | Deadly | Severe   | Minor  | Minor      |
| Near      | 76-100   | Deadly    | Severe | Minor    | Minor  | Low        |
| Inner     | 01-25    | Deadly    | Deadly | Severe   | Minor  | Minor      |
| Inner     | 26-75    | Deadly    | Severe | Minor    | Minor  | Low        |
| Inner     | 76-100   | Severe    | Minor  | Minor    | Low    | Low        |
| Habitable | 01-25    | Deadly    | Severe | Minor    | Minor  | Minor      |
| Habitable | 26-75    | Severe    | Minor  | Minor    | Low    | Low        |
| Habitable | 76-100   | Minor     | Minor  | Minor    | Low    | Low        |
| Outer     | 01-25    | Severe    | Minor  | Minor    | Minor  | Minor      |
| Outer     | 26-75    | Minor     | Minor  | Low      | Low    | Low        |
| Outer     | 76-100   | Minor     | Minor  | Low      | Low    | Low        |
| Far       | 01-25    | Minor     | Minor  | Minor    | Low    | Low        |
| Far       | 26-75    | Minor     | Low    | Low      | Low    | Low        |
| Far       | 76-100   | Low       | Low    | Low      | Low    | Low        |

Now that you have a base radiation level determined by proximity to the primary star of the system, atmospheric pressure, and percentage of surface liquid, you can adjust it based on a die roll on the table below (to determine base planetary core radioactivity). Cross reference the value from table above and roll on the table below.

| D10 | Core Radioactivity | Low   | Minor  | Severe | Lethal |
| --- | ------------------ | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1   | None               | Low   | Low    | Minor  | Minor  |
| 2-3 | Some               | Low   | Low    | Minor  | Severe |
| 4-7 | Typical            | Low   | Minor  | Severe | Deadly |
| 8-9 | Severe             | Minor | Minor  | Deadly | Deadly |
| 10  | Extreme            | Minor | Severe | Deadly | Deadly |

What do these Radiation Levels Mean in Starstriders or 5e?

- Low: Planets with Low radiation either have a thick enough atmosphere to filter out the radiation from the star, have very little water present in the atmosphere, have lower core planetary radioactivity, or are far enough away from the system’s star that radiation just isn’t a factor.
  - Radiation can be expressed as 0.001 to 0.1 Galactic Standard Radiation (use 1d100 * 0.001).
  - There is no ill effect on characters exposed to this level of radiation.
  - Life can exist on a planet with Low radiation exposure
- Minor: Planets with minor radiation exposure are being hit with more extremes. Either it is in close proximity to its star or it lacks much water-based atmosphere. Such planets are hostile to biological things.
  - Radiation can be expressed as 2 to 20 Galactic Standard Radiation (use 2d10)
  - Assume characters exposed to this level of radiation without some type of environmental or vacsuit become ill and suffer a radiation value of minor (see chapter 10)
  - Life cannot exist unassisted on a planet with Minor radiation exposure.
- Severe: These planets are bombarded constantly with high levels of radiation. Nothing biological can last long.
  - Radiation can be expressed as 20 to 200 Galactic Standard Radiation (use 2d10x10)
  - Assume characters exposed to this level of radiation without some level of environmental or vacsuit become very ill. If exposure is too long, Referees can consider more permanent damage effects. See Chapter 10
  - Life cannot exist unassisted on a planet with Severe radiation exposure.
- Deadly: The planet is a hot spot of radioactivity, deadly to all in, on, or around it.
  - Radiation can be expressed as 200 or more Galactic Standard Radiation (use 2d10x100)
  - Assume characters exposed to even one turn at this level of radiation without some level of environmental or vacsuit become very ill and suffer radiation sickness see chapter 10
  - Life cannot exist unassisted on a planet with Deadly radiation exposure.

#### 5. Atmosphere Toxicity
The presence of an atmosphere does not guarantee that the air is breathable. Roll 1d10 on the following table (refer to the Toxicity section of Chapter 10). If toxins are present, arbitrarily assume they are some combination of ammonia, chlorine, fluorine, hydrogen, methane, or some other non-inert element. Most habitable planets will have no toxicity, but if they do the flora and fauna has adapted to its trace toxins.

| D100  | Toxicity Hazard   |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| 00-49 | Normal, no hazard |
| 50-69 | Trace Hazard      |
| 70-79 | Mild Hazard       |
| 80-89 | Moderate Hazard   |
| 90-99 | Severe Hazard     |

> Continuing with Jack he has 1 moon that might have life to check this one is in Zone 3 the Habitable Zone
> Moon 1: .51G, .66 Mass, 38% Hydrosphere, Thin Atmosphere, .48 Pressure, Minor Radiation, No Atmospheric Toxicity

#### 6. Surface Temperature
This table represent the most common temperature found on the planet. Some terrestrial atmospheres that are dense hold in heat while thin atmospheres release heat. Consider unusual sources of heat or cold, such as underground steam vents warmed by the planet’s core, volcanic activity, or proximity to a hot Jovian.

| Zone      | Very Dense | Dense    | Moderate | Thin     | Very Thin |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------- |
| Near      | Inferno    | Inferno  | Hot      | Hot      | Moderate  |
| Inner     | Inferno    | Hot      | Hot      | Hot      | Moderate  |
| Habitable | Hot        | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate | Cold      |
| Outer     | Moderate   | Cold     | Cold     | Cold     | Frozen    |
| Far       | Moderate   | Cold     | Cold     | Frozen   | Frozen    |

- **Frozen**: -100 to -200 degrees Celsius (use 1d100-200) No life can exist at this temperature extreme. 4d10/round Cold Damage exposed without proper gear
- **Cold**: -100 to 0 degrees Celsius (use 1d100-100) Life can exist but only in certain areas. 2d10/turn Cold Damage exposed without proper gear
- **Moderate**: 0 to 20 degrees Celsius (use 1d100/5) Planet’s average annual surface temperature is acceptable for life to thrive.
- **Hot**: 20 to 200 degrees Celsius (use 2d10x1d10) Life can exist but only in certain areas. 2d10/turn Fire damage exposed without proper gear
- **Inferno**: 200 to 600 degrees Celsius (use 4d10x1d10+200) No life can exist at this temperature. 4d10/round Fire Damage exposed without proper gear

##### Axial Tilt
A planet with a higher axial tilt exhibits more extreme surface temperatures, as well as annual cyclic variation in the number of hours of daylight in a planet’s rotation period. If you wish, you can determine axial tilt of your planet as follows:

`D100 - 50`

This produces a result approximately in the range of -50° to +50°, though it is technically possible to exceed this. A tile of +/- 25° produces seasonal results similar to Earth.

> Moon 1: .51G, .66 Mass, 38% Hydrosphere, Thin Atmosphere, .48 Pressure, Minor Radiation, No Atmospheric Toxicity, Moderate Temperature, 23 acial tilt so very similar seasons to Earth

#### 7. Length of Day
Length of day in this game refers to the average time (in Galactic Standard Hours, not local hours) for the planet’s star to move from the noon position in the sky at a point on the equator back to the same position. It’s the period of rotation for a planet’s axis. Roll on the following table and then pick a value from the range provided.

| D100  | Result                  | Galactic Standard Hours |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 00-09 | Very fast length of day | up to 7 hours           |
| 10-29 | Fast length of day      | 7 - 15 hours            |
| 30-69 | Typical length of day   | 15 - 30 hours           |
| 70-89 | Slow length of day      | 30 - 60 hours           |
| 90-99 | Very slow length of day | 60 or more hours        |

> Continuing with Jack he has 1 moon that might have life to check this one is in Zone 3 the Habitable Zone
> Moon 1: .51G, .66 Mass, 38% Hydrosphere, Thin Atmosphere, .48 Pressure, Minor Radiation, No Atmospheric Toxicity, Moderate Temperature, 23 acial tilt so very similar seasons to Earth
> Very Fast Days about 7 hours (1d8-1), 6 Hours

#### 8. Length of Year
The length of a year is how long a planet takes to revolve around its home star. Roll on the following table (use the column described by your planet’s zone) and then pick a value for the length of year from the range provided. If you are detailing a moon orbiting a Jovian, you might use the moon’s rotation around the gas giant as the basis for your “year,” or you might consider using the Jovian’s rotation as the basis instead.

| Inner Zone | Habitable Zone | Outer Zone | Length of Year             |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| 00-29      | 00-09          | 00         | Very fast (up to 125 days) |
| 30-59      | 10-29          | 01-09      | Fast (125 to 250 days)     |
| 60-89      | 30-69          | 10-39      | Typical (250 to 500 days)  |
| 90-98      | 70-89          | 40-69      | Slow (500 - 1,000 days)    |
| 99         | 90-99          | 70-99      | Very slow (1,000+ days)    |

> Very Fast Days about 7 hours
> Very Fast Years about 125 days or less (1d12x10) 110 Days

#### 9. Dominant Terrain
This table lists the most prevalent type of terrain characters can expect to find on this planet. That is not to say it’s the only type found; in any given coordinates, characters can find anything the Referee permits. Use the column that represents the zone your planet is in when rolling on the following table.

| Inner Zone | Habitable Zone | Outer Zone | Dominant Terrain               |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 00-21      | 00-09          | --         | Lava Beds                      |
| 22-40      | 10-19          | 00-02      | Desert, Wastelands, Salt Flats |
| 41-56      | 20-29          | 03-06      | Canyons, Ravines, Stonelands   |
| 57-69      | 30-39          | 07-12      | Mountains, Crags, Ridges       |
| 70-79      | 40-49          | 13-20      | Jungle, Rainforest             |
| 80-87      | 50-59          | 21-30      | Hills, Steppes, Slopes         |
| 88-93      | 60-69          | 31-43      | Swamp, Bog, Marsh              |
| 84-97      | 70-79          | 44-59      | Plains, Savannas, Prairies     |
| 98-99      | 80-89          | 60-78      | Forest, Woods                  |
| --         | 90-99          | 79-99      | Tundra, Glacier                |

> Dominant Terrain is Bogs, Swamps and Marshes

#### 10. Dominant Lifeform
Now that we know it’s possible the planet might support life, what kind of life is it? You can decide this based on the needs of your story or can roll on the following table. It will help determine the highest level of development the dominant lifeform has achieved on this planet, if there is life. If you roll an “Animal” result be creative if you get "Humanoid" you have yourself a Habited planet use the GWP section below to determine the details and Generate a GWP code.

| D100  | Result             |
| ----- | ------------------ |

#### 11. Planet Descriptions

D100


- **00** Cool, frequent hurricane activity along the thirtieth parallel causes tsunamis along the coasts. Safer land can be found inland where expanses of dense forests make it difficult to travel, even on foot. 
- **01** Temperate climate with violent hurricane activity along southern latitudes. Large masses of ice floes bring northern wildlife to southern regions, upsetting the natural balance. 02 The planet has a completely temperate climate with vast plains and tundra in the northern hemisphere. 
- **03** This lush swamp planet has cold rains that have a mild toxicity required by many living things in the savanna regions. The world is dividing into two large land masses separated by a toxic sea. 
- **04** A glacial planet that is slowly being terra-formed into a cool temperate planet. 
- **05** Huge islands are troubled by sweeping dust winds, and very few trees exist on this world. 
- **06** Tornados are common in the lowlands nearest the shores. Most land masses have plains that are interrupted by rolling hills. 
- **07** Dark clouds with greenish coloration represent trace amounts of ionized copper molecules often found in the upper atmosphere. Large forests give way to tundra on this cold world. 
- **08** This world is plagued by frequent hail storms that form without warning. Volcanic activity spews minerals into the air that affect sensors and navigation instruments. 
- **09** There is no cloud cover over land because some unexplained lunar effect keeps cloud cover stationary over water. 
- **10** Due to its axial tilt and rotation, half of the planet is in twilight while the other is broad daylight. 
- **11** A single massive land-mass dominates with large pockets of lakes. 
- **12** The entire land mass on this planet is an archipelago. 
- **13** Swathes of lush rain-forest dominate the equatorial regions, while islands of ice float in the far reaches of the northern and southern hemispheres. 
- **14** The planet is pitted with volcanic activity giving way to rich-soil deposits, creating a perpetual forest. 
- **15** Monolithic craters formed from underground fissures dot most of the planet, offering the best soil for colorful exuberant vegetation. 
- **16** Mostly prairie grasslands on several large continents separated by vast oceans. 
- **17** Bogs and marshes cover most of the central continents with outlying islands of lush conifer forests dotting the oceanscape. 
- **18** Most continents are marshland with huge morasses. This muddy ball of a planet has frequent mudslides in the hilly and mountainous regions. 
- **19** An ice ball scored in many places with kilometer deep canyons and colossal caverns. 
- **20** Very few bodies of water give way to this planet’s vast forest of gargantuan trees. 
- **21** Deep fertile crags dwell in the shadows of tall ice- covered mountain peaks, kept warm by hot springs that dot the landscape. 
- **22** Terrain is mostly flat with seas of dry silt separating a handful of land masses. 
- **23** Tall floral tree stalks cover the landscape of most of the planet, the large red petal canopy casting crimson shade. The high lands are covered in an equally red moss vegetation. 
- **24** The planet is plagued by unstable land mass movements and plate tectonic activity, causing quakes strong enough to destroy small structures without proper reinforcement. 
- **25** The atmosphere takes abnormally long to build up enough water vapor to form clouds large enough to cause rain, resulting in years of drought followed by years of harsh rain. 
- **26** This world has an ever-present light effect similar to the Aurora Borealis, filling the sky with green, red, or purple ambient light streaks of electro-magnetically charged photon particles. 
- **27** The thick cloud-filled atmosphere is ever present over the entire world and causes instruments and scanners to misread data. 
- **28** The local plant and animals all have hard exterior shells to protect them from the deadly asteroid storms that have been raging here for a thousand years. 
- **29** Quartz-lined caves fill the valleys here, while winds sweep across the hills and create harmonic whistles and hums. The hills here are literally alive... with the sound of music. 
- **30** Land masses have stepped elevations rather than gradual slopes, some of which rise hundreds of meters. Waterfalls are plentiful and common. 
- **31** Very deep canyons are filled with life, while the surface of this world is almost inhospitable. 
- **32** This world is one forest with huge trees. Mountains break up the forest in such a way you can see the face of a Yar. 
- **33** This red planet gets its color from the numerous lava flows prevalent around this world. 
- **34** A world of whiteness, covered in layers of thick ice with few mountain peaks. 
- **35** This world is a stinky, smelly, foul swamp covered in thick acidic fog. 
- **36** A thick atmosphere containing minerals of different colors gives this world a rainbow-like look. 
- **37** A mountainous world with pockets of flat steppes. 
- **38** This world is a vast ocean where some areas have land just below the surface. 
- **39** Vast mountain ranges are broken by small deserts and savannahs. 
- **40** Volcanic activity feeds lush jungles. Oddly, there are no creatures on this world, only plants and insects. 
- **41** Two large oceans look like puppy-eyes from space, surrounded by a mixture of jungles, bogs, rain-forests, and marshes. 
- **42** The atmosphere hangs low to the ground, by planetary standards. Most tall mounts stick up past the atmosphere into the vacuum of space. 
- **43** Natural rock formations exist in clean right-angles, seemingly impossible by natural standards. This can fool starship scans for signs of cultures. 
- **44** The planet is plagued by storms of acid rain. Local lifeforms have adapted or seek shelter from it. 
- **45** Natural electromagnetic formations of minerals generate enough disturbance that conventional RF communication will not function reliably. 
- **46** Natural oil deposits run in thick muck-like streams through canyons located in the northern hemisphere. 
- **47** The entire planet hosts one singular continent, with all water existing in thousands of small lakes, each of which connect through underground tunnels. 
- **48** There is a vast network of caves located beneath the surface, an underworld with nearly as much surface area to live in as the actual planet’s surface. 
- **49** All of the trees that exist on the planet share a common root network, intertwining and sharing nutrients and water. 
- **50** Stalks of a local plant are an extraordinary building material; they are malleable and formable when cut, but quickly dry to a hardened epoxy-like state within one local day. 
- **51** The planet was once used as a dumping ground for another interstellar culture – trash is everywhere. Although nothing arrives anymore, it may be possible to calculate the trajectory of where the trash canisters originated and go there, to see who is out there! 
- **52** The land masses here formed like rock crystals on the surface of the planet’s water, and float about the planet in casual drifts. 
- **53** The surface of the planet is covered with coral-like growths that cause excruciating pain on contact. Native animals mostly float in the air using helium- bladders. 
- **54** Most liquid water exists in arid stagnation, covered over with a thick layer of surface moss. It’s difficult to differentiate it from surrounding growth and can easily swallow up a traveler who isn’t paying close attention. 
- **55** All vegetation on this world has a purple hue. The growth cycles are reversed, with most plants converting moonlight into energy rather than sunlight. 
- **56** A range of humongous lizards dominate this world, from behemoth tree-leaf eaters to tyrannical meat- eaters that seek herbivores as their food source. Not only are the animals huge, the plants and insects are as well. A dragonfly could easily lift a character into the air. 
- **57** Dominated by several large jungles whose canopies are tightly intertwined, allowing most ground vehicles to pass easily. 
- **58** A network of rivers that appears as veins when viewed from space empties into a single ocean. 
- **59** The only cloud cover on this world is from active volcanoes, which spew rocks and debris into the upper atmosphere hampering landing attempts. 
- **60** This world’s mineral and crystalline deposits outweigh its rock formations. The planet looks like a giant metal ball. 
- **61** The planet is filled with humongous crystals that jut out of the ground at different angles. It’s not uncommon for crystals that are in close proximity to arc energy back and forth, scorching trees or anything else in their path. 
- **62** The planet endures an unusual amount of electrical activity as lightning arcs mercilessly to the surface from the sky. The deserts and beaches contain acres of glass-like formations caused by the electricity and sand. 
- **63** This world’s crust is a shell, and the interior is filled with mountains giving way to vast forests of knee-high scrub brush. 
- **64** The planet is old, even older than its star. When the primary star of its previous system failed, it was flung as a rogue planet into the galaxy, until it was caught by the mass of this star. It has remnants of a culture that died long ago along with its previous home star. 
- **65** Local plant life is wide and flat, and has no roots. It is carried by the winds to draw nutrients from surface soil wherever it lands. 
- **66** Tall cactus-like trees form the bulk of most forest regions, some of which are mobile and move about in tree herds, seeking better access to sunlight and surface water and nutrients. 
- **67** Tungsten exists in a strand-like form on this world, and can take on a glow like a light bulb when those filaments touch on dissimilar metals. It’s not uncommon to see caves with natural dim lighting. 
- **68** Loose iron particles cover the surface of the planet, causing it to have a red hue. The planet’s poles undergo magnetic shifts every D00 years, causing the iron particles to shift and stand on end for about an hour. 
- **69** Animals who die here often get back up and hunger for living meat. This is not some zombie apocalypse; it’s a parasite that attaches itself to the host’s nervous system and gains some level of control when no longer competing with the host’s own bioelectric system. The only way to permanently kill it is to damage the brain enough to prevent the parasite’s control.

- **70** Naturally occurring magnetic elements cause compasses not to function on this world. 
- **71** Tornados are so common here that it’s rare to see none on the horizon. Fortunately, due to pressure variances, the tornados never touch the planet’s surface but instead hover 10 meters above ground as they roam about almost randomly. 
- **72** The planet has a debris cloud streaking through the atmosphere, shielding it from the light of the star. It’s not a complete ring, and moves around in a single long cloud. 
- **73** A local plant on this world has medicinal properties that might solve some complex medical limitation or problem. 
- **74** A crystalline growth on this world has some potential to store oxygen even more compactly than the crystals used to store oxygen in starships and enviro- suits and may revolutionize long-term exploration of dangerous regions. 
- **75** A complex silicate grows here that may hold the secret to creating smaller and more densely packed EU devices. 
- **76** A bacteria present on this world may hold the solution to longevity treatments that have eluded all species (or a specific species) for millennia. 
- **77** An infectious bacteria can cause injuries to go septic in mere hours, and has all but destroyed many of the planet’s local lifeforms. 
- **78** The planet has a breed of very dangerous predator that hibernates under the soil for dozens of years and awaits rain seasons, which awaken it to feed. 
- **79** The strange fibrous structure of the trees here create screaming noises when the tree bough bends from the winds, rather than the traditional creaking and moaning that most trees make. The screaming trees can be frightening until you’re used to them. 
- **80** This world has a very slow rotation, and plants and animals have adapted to follow the summer in a continuous path of migration. 
- **81** This world is a continuous salt flat broken up by rolling hills that give way to high mountains. 
- **82** A desert world of vast forests of scrub brush and pocket lakes. 
- **83** This world is mostly comprised of a black obsidian-like rock crystal that absorbs all light and appears as a dark ball in space. 
- **84** A sea in the northern hemisphere feeds several river systems that eventually form deltas that empty into the ocean. 
- **85** A freshwater ocean world with small continents of evergreen forests. 
- **86** Life formed on the backs of crystals on this world of mountains and vast cave systems below the crust. 
- **87** All biological beings on this planet have semi- transparent skin. Seeing an animal’s interior organs is normal. 
- **88** The planet undergoes cyclical devastating surface reversals, where sinkholes slowly claim the surface soil and molten lava seeps up to replace it. This eternal cycle takes D00 years to complete and makes land- bound native lifeforms unlikely. 
- **89** One (or more?) of this planet’s moons is in a degrading orbit and has been causing untold increasing effects on the tide. It only has another D00 years before a collision causes planetary apocalypse. 
- **90** The planet has diverse and numerous types of indigenous trees. During certain seasons, their leaves dry up and die, creating the most amazing colors. 
- **91** The planet has a sunset of immeasurable beauty, caused by its layers of nonhomogeneous gases in the atmosphere. 
- **92** The planet has a negligible axial tilt, creating an extremely stable and predictable environment. 
- **93** The planet smells sweet, like honey or berries, due to pollen spores common to the highlands. 
- **94** No beaches exist on this world. Land masses jut out of the waters forming cliffs many meters in height. 
- **95** A pulsating electrical current passes through minerals in the ground on this planet, going from lowlands to highlands (opposite of rivers). The pulses always occur in a cycle of D00 minutes. 
- **96**-99 - Roll twice.

#### Creating Habitated Worlds
For Astra Genesis we use the Cepheus Engine system, the presence of star systems is marked on hex maps, each hex representing one parsec. For each system, generate a Galactic World Profile for the primary world of the system. The smallest astrogation map size, the Sector, measures 10 hexes wide by 10 hexes high. An intermediate map size, the sector block, measures four secotrs by four sectors, while the largest map size, the quadrant, measures two sector blocks by two sector block. Technically there is a size called Region that measures two quadrants by two qudrants but they are almost never used.

There is a basic one-half chance normally that a world (and its attendant stellar system) will be in a hex. Systematically check each hex on the subsector map, throwing 1d20 and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 1-10 and note on scratch paper what you rolled. This indicates that a world is present; otherwise, leave the hex blank. The GM may elect to alter the normal chances of worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent to correspond to specific regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM) is appropriate for the Astra Genesis. Apply a –2 DM for 'Wild Space', a –1 DM for sparse or Rampart sectors and a +1 DM for densely populated sectors like the ones in Sector Blocks 1 and 2. Once you know which Systems have a System in them any of them that have a 1-5 have a Habitable world, 6-10 have no habitable worlds but do have planets so continue generation as below. (see Inhabitable Worlds Tables). 

##### World Size

The Size characteristic for habitable worlds ranges from 0 to 10, and is determined by rolling 2D6–2. 

| 2D6-2  | World Size                     | Surface Gravity (gs) |

**High and Low Gravity Worlds**

Worlds where the gravity is 0.75 or less are low-gravity worlds. Common features include improbable-looking rock formations, thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enough to support flyers). Humans tend to find life on low-gravity worlds to be initially pleasant, but regular exercise regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation. Those who spent too long on low-gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities. Characters on low-gravity worlds suffer Disadvantage to all physical skill checks until they acclimatize, a process which takes 1D6 weeks.

High-gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth. They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include wide rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures, and plant life that spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing or swimming are the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans find high-gravity worlds unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds require the use of pressured or powered suits to support the human frame. Characters on high-gravity worlds suffer Disadvantage to all physical skill checks until they acclimatize, a process which takes 1D6 weeks

##### Atmosphere

A planet's Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the planet's Size. If a world's Size equals 0, then the world's Atmosphere equals 0. The Atmosphere code should never be higher than 15(F). 

| 2d6-7  | Atmosphere         | Pressure      | Survival Gear Required |
| :----- | :----------------- | :------------ | :--------------------- |
| 0      | None               | 0.00          | Vacc Suit              |

| 9      | Dense, Tainted     | 1.5 to 2.49   | Filter                 |
| 10 (A) | Exotic             | Varies        | Air Supply             |

**Atmosphere Types**

- **Tainted**
  - Tainted atmospheres contain some element that is harmful to humans, such as an unusually high proportion of carbon dioxide. A character who breathes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will suffer 1D6 damage every few minutes (or hours, depending on the level of taint).
- **Exotic**
  - An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans, but is not otherwise hazardous. A character needs an air supply to breath in an exotic atmosphere.
**Corrosive**
  - Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A character who breathes in a corrosive atmosphere will suffer 1D6 damage each round.
**Insidious**
  - An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one, but it is so corrosive that it attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in an insidious atmosphere is that the toxic gases will destroy the seals and filters on the character's protective gear. An insidious atmosphere worms its way past protection after 2D6 hours on average, although vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival times. 
**- Dense, High (D)**
  - These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres, but their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there are highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support human life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough for humans to inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on the surface.
- **Thin, Low (E)**
  - The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere, these massive worlds have thin N2/O2 atmospheres that settle in the lowlands and depressions and are only breathable there – the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points of the surface may be close to vacuum.
- **Unusual (F)**
  - An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by storms so intense that that the local air pressure changes from dense to thin depending on the current weather; and other planets with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

##### Hydrographics

Hydrographic percentage is obtained by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the world's Size, modified by the world's atmosphere or size as described in the Hydrographic DMs by Size and Atmosphere table. 

| Condition                  | DM                      |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
| Size 0 or 1                | Hydrographics must be 0 |
| Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B or C | –4                      |
| Atmosphere E               | –2                      |

A world's Hydrographics value should never exceed 10 (A), nor may it be lower than 0. 

| 2d6-7  | Hydrographic Percentage | Description                                |
| :----- | :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 0%–5%                   | Desert world                               |
| 1      | 6%–15%                  | Dry world                                  |
| 2      | 16%–25%                 | A few small seas.                          |
| 3      | 26%–35%                 | Small seas and oceans.                     |
| 4      | 36%–45%                 | Wet world                                  |
| 5      | 46%–55%                 | Large oceans                               |
| 6      | 56%–65%                 |                                            |
| 7      | 66%–75%                 | Earth-like world                           |
| 8      | 76%–85%                 | Water world                                |
| 9      | 86%–95%                 | Only a few small islands and archipelagos. |
| 10 (A) | 96–100%                 | Almost entirely water.                     |

##### World Population

A world's Population is generated by rolling 2D6–2, modified by the world's Size, Atmosphere and Hydrographics as described in the Population DMs table. A world's Population value should never exceed 10 (A). If a world has a population of 0, it is uninhabited and the world also has a Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0. 

| Condition                                     | DM   |
| :-------------------------------------------- | :--- |
| Size is 2 or less                             | -1   |

**Population Modifier**

Sometimes it is enough just to know that a world has hundreds of millions of people on it (Population 8). Other times, a GM or player may want a more specific number. **The Population Modifier is determined by rolling 2D6-2**. If the Population is greater than 0, the minimum Population Modifier value is 1. If the Population code is 0, then the Population Modifier is also 0. The Population Modifier is multiplied by 10 raised to the power of the Population code to determine a more specific number of people living on the world. For example, if the GM generates a Population Modifier of 4 for a world with a Population code of 8, then he knows that (4x10^8, which is…) 400,000,000 people live on that world. 

> Setting Designer this paragraph confused the hell out of me.
> They Mean take the number 10 raise it to the power of the Population code.
> For the example they were missing the carrot symbol ^

**Important!**: These numbers are **massive** and way too big for this setting. 

##### Primary Starport
Many worlds have starports, their presence being essential to interstellar trade and commerce. To determine the world's primary starport, roll 2D6-7 and add the world's Population value. Compare the result to the Primary Starport table to determine the starport class for the world. Each starport class offers different levels of service. The Starport Class Services table provides more specific details.

##### World Government
The Government characteristic is determined by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the world's Population. If a world's Population equals 0, then the world's Government equals 0. The Government code should never be higher than 15(F), nor lower than 0. 

| Type   | Government                  |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |
| 0      | None                        |

##### Law Level
Law level is determined by rolling 2D6–7 and adding the Government characteristic. If the world's Government is 0, then the world's Law Level is also 0. Law Level should never be less than 0.

##### Technology Level

The Technology Level (also called "tech level" or TL) of the world is determined by rolling 1D6 and adding DMs per the Technology Level DMs by UWP Values table. A world's Technology Level may not be below 0. 

| Value  | Starport | Size | Atmosphere | Hydrographics | Population | Government |
| :----- | :------- | :--- | :--------- | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| 0      |          | +2   | +1         | +1            |            | +1         |
| 1      |          | +2   | +1         |               | +1         |            |

| 3      |          | +1   | +1         |               | +1         |            |
| 4      |          | +1   |            |               | +1         |            |
| 5      |          |      |            |               | +1         | +1         |
| 6      |          |      |            |               |            |            |
| 7      |          |      |            |               |            | +2         |
| 8      |          |      |            |               |            |            |
| 9      |          |      |            | +1            | +1         |            |
| 10 (A) | +6       |      | +1         | +2            | +2         |            |
| 11 (B) | +4       |      | +1         |               | +3         |            |
| 12 (C) | +2       |      | +1         |               | +4         |            |
| 13 (D) |          |      | +1         |               |            | –2         |
| 14 (E) |          |      | +1         |               |            | –2         |
| X      | –4       |      |            |               |            |            |

Certain world conditions must meet a minimum Technology Level requirement. If the world possesses a lower technology level, then the GM should increase the world's tech level to the required minimum. 

Tech level stops pretty much at 14, anything above 14 is INCREDIBLY rare.

| Conditions                                            | Minimum TL |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| Hydrographics is 0 or 10(A), Population is at least 6 | 4          |
| Atmosphere is 4, 7 or 9                               | 5          |
| Atmosphere is 3 or less, or 10(A)-12(C)               | 7          |
| Atmosphere is 13(D) or 14(E), Hydrographics is 10(A)  | 7          |

##### Trade Codes

Trade codes are assigned based on a world's UWP values, as noted in the UWP Values for Trade Codes table. They have to **meet** all the criteria in a given line left to right to get that code.

| Classification   | Code | Size | Atmos.    | Hydro | Pop. | Gov. | Law  | TL   |

##### ~~Planetoid Belt Presence~~ DEPRECATED

Planetoid belts exist in many systems, and are mined by belters for ice, ore and other interesting things. To determine the presence of planetoid belts in a given star system, throw 4+ on 2D6 for at least one planetoid belt to be present in the system. If planetoid belts are present, then the number of planetoid belts in the system is 1D6-3, minimum of 1. If the primary world of the system is Size 0, then there's at least one planetoid belt in the system automatically.

##### ~~Gas Giant Presence~~ DEPRECATED

A star system may have one or more gas giant planets. The presence of a gas giant allows starships equipped with fuel scoops to refuel by skimming; this eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases profit. It also allows refueling at systems that do not have starports. Refueling in this fashion requires 1D6 hours per 40 tons of fuel.

Gas giants are relatively common. For each system throw 5+ on 2D6 for at least one gas giant to be present in the system. If gas giants are present, then the number of gas giants in the system is 1D6-2, minimum of 1.

##### Bases

Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the navy, the scouts, or for other arms of interstellar government. Bases can help determine political boundaries within a given region of space. An interstellar government will place bases along its borders to guard against aggression from rival states, or to control local systems. The presence of multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a contested border, or a mighty stronghold. While other bases may exist, the two primary bases are the Naval Base and the Scout Base.

###### Naval Base

A naval base is a supply depot, refueling station, repair yard or fortress of the Navy. Naval vessels can obtain refined fuel and supplies here. If a world possesses a Class-A or Class-B starport, throw 8+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of a naval base in the system.

###### Scout Base

A scout base or outpost offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships. If a world does not possess a Class-E or Class-X starport, throw 7+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of a scout base in the system. This roll suffers a DM -1 if the world has a Class-C starport, a DM -2 for a Class-B starport and a DM -3 for a Class-A starport.

###### Pirate Base

A pirate base serves as a haven for interstellar pirates. If a world does not possess a Class-A starport or a naval base, throw 12+ on 2D6 to determine the presence of a pirate base in the system.

###### Base Codes

The presence of one or more bases is designated on the hex map with a base code in the upper-left of the world hex. The Base Codes table identifies which note-worthy bases, if any, are present


| Code | Description                        |
| :--- | :--------------------------------- |
| A    | Naval Base and Scout Base/Outpost  |
| G    | Scout Base/Outpost and Pirate Base |
| N    | Naval Base                         |
| P    | Pirate Base                        |
| S    | Scout Base/Outpost                 |

> Has 1 star 


##### Travel Zones

Most worlds are assumed to be civilized, or at least amenable to adventurers and other visitors. Some, however, are caught in the throes of war, plagued by disease, or simply not ready for interstellar visitors. Such worlds are classified by travel zones to denote such status. In most cases, the GM should indicate travel zones based on the information available. Two such zone types exist: amber and red.

###### Amber Zone

An Amber world has been deemed dangerous, and travelers are warned to be on their guard. Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval or revolution, or else are naturally hazardous environments. A world with an Atmosphere of 10+, a government of 0, 7 or 10, or a Law Level of 0 or 9+ should be considered for Amber status.

###### Red Zone

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden. Interdictions are enforced by the Navy. Red zones can indicate that the world is too dangerous to allow visitors. The GM assigns Red worlds at his discretion.

###### ~~Polities and World Allegiance~~ Deprecated

Worlds may be independent, or part of a larger polity that spans a system or more. Polities range from loose confederations of a few worlds with common trade or defense policies or cultural links, to vast star empires containing thousands of systems and trillions of citizens. Polity borders should be drawn on the map. Note that larger polities will usually have sub-domains, which should also be marked.
Communications Routes and Trade Routes

Within the subsector, governments will have established communications and trade routes connecting some (but not all) worlds. Messages between businesses, governments and people generally follow these routes.

Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid making all parts of the subsector accessible; a subsector should have some areas as backwaters for exploration and adventure. Communications routes are drawn as single lines connecting hexes on the subsector grid.

Trade routes link worlds that have strong commercial ties. Consult the Trade Route Worlds table– if any pair of worlds matching the two columns lay within four parsecs of each other, and there is a Jump–1 or Jump–2 route between them, then mark a trade route connecting those two worlds.
