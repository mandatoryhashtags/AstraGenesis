## Inspiration
Inspiration in Astra Genesis is a bit different. Characters generally start each game session with a point of Inspiration, they gain more from their Destiny and other sources. We have different ways to spend Inspiration.

- Initiative Break. You can expend an inspiration point to move their order in initiative. So long as they have not already taken a turn this round.
- Recharge. You can expend an inspiration point to regain an expended resource or feature that can be used as if you took a short rest.
- Shielding. If you have a PSG this will recharge it even if you do not have one; you can expend an inspiration point to roll a number of available Hit Die up to your proficiency bonus. Add your Constitution modifier to that roll and you gain those hit points as temporary hit points. The temporary hit points last for 1 hour.
- Surging Strike. You can expend an inspiration point on your turn, you can take one attack action or cast a cantrip with the cast a spell action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus action.
- Exhaustion Recovery. You can expend an inspiration point on your turn to regain some of your energy. You regain your proficiency bonus worth of charges to use on Maneuvers
- Swift Action. You can expend an inspiration point on your turn to take the Dash, Dodge, Disengage or Use Object action for free.
- Defensive Warding. You can expend an inspiration point to rally your allies' defenses. When a creature that you can see makes an attack roll or an ability check, you can impose disadvantage on that roll. You must use this after the roll, but before you know the outcome.
- Deaths Busy. You can expend an inspiration point to automatically stabilize when making death-saving throws.
- I Know a Guy. You can expend an inspiration point when you need a piece of information on an item, monster, location, or person. You know a guy or girl who will have further details regarding how to acquire the information you seek.   
- But Wait, We Planned for This. You edit the scene by mentioning a way how your character, off-screen, planned ahead and set things up for this exact situation
