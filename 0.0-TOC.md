# Ackowledgements
- Special Thanks: To Bob, for giving me the two greatest gifts in life. A father figure and teaching me the magical world of table top gaming.
- Very Special Thanks: To Dove, for being there to game test, sound board, and always giving me an ear when I wanted to talk game mechanics even when you really didn't want to.
- Finally, writing this took time away from my family, my friends, and my life. So I would like to say thank you to everyone for being patient with me.
