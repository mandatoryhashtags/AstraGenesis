# 8. Using Ability Scores
Every creature has six ability scores to describe their physical attributes and mental characteristics: Strength for muscle, Dexterity for agility and reflexes, Constitution for health and hardiness, Intelligence for memory and wits, Wisdom for awareness and intuition, and Charisma for charm and force of personality. An ability score of 10 or 11 is average. Adventurers can reach scores as high as 20, and monsters can have ability scores as high as 30.

Each ability has a modifier derived from its score. Table: Ability Score Modifiers lists the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30, but note only through extraordinary circumstances can a player character have an ability score below 8 or above 20. The most common rolls of the game—ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws—rely on the ability modifiers derived from the six ability scores. Because ability modifiers affect almost every roll, they come up during play more often than their associated scores.

## Ability Checks
An ability check is made to determine whether a creature succeeds at a task other than an attack. The Narrator chooses which ability the creature should use and assigns a number representing the task’s Difficulty Class or DC. The more difficult the task, the higher its DC (see Table: Typical Difficulty Classes).

| TASK DIFFICULTY   | DC  |
| ----------------- | --- |
| Very easy         | 5   |
| Easy              | 10  |
| Medium            | 15  |
| Hard              | 20  |
| Very hard         | 25  |
| Nearly impossible | 30  |

To make an ability check for a certain ability, roll a d20 and add the ability’s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the creature succeeds at the task. Otherwise, the creature fails, making little or no progress towards its goal.

## Passive Checks
A passive check is an ability check made without die rolls. It can represent a creature’s typical result on a repeated task. To determine a character’s total for a passive check, add 10 to the ability’s modifier and any other relevant bonuses and penalties. If the character has advantage on the check, add 5, and if they have an expertise die add 3. If the character has disadvantage, subtract 5.

The most common use of a passive check is a passive Wisdom (Perception) check. When a character first experiences a new scene or location, the Narrator describes what they sense based on their perceptiveness. A highly perceptive character might automatically detect dangers a less perceptive character wouldn’t notice, such as hidden opponents or traps.

## Contests
When one creature’s efforts directly oppose another’s, the outcome is determined by contested ability checks—a contest. Each contestant makes an ability check as normal. Instead of comparing the results to a DC, the participant with the higher check wins the contest. If the results are tied, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest.

An initiative check is a type of contested ability check to determine the order of action during an encounter.

## Advantage, Disadvantage, Expertise, and DC Modifiers
When the Narrator asks for an ability check, it might be modified by circumstances, spells, features, or traits that grant advantage (roll twice and use the higher result), disadvantage (roll twice and use the lower result), or expertise dice (roll and add an extra die).

When the player knows about the factors which affect their action, these usually take the form of expertise dice or advantage or disadvantage. Expertise dice represent training and other details, and the character taking the action is fully aware of these effects.

Sometimes the Narrator knows about factors which affect the difficulty of a task that the player is not aware of. In these situations the Narrator secretly applies modifiers to the DC of the ability check.

## Using Each Ability

### Strength

#### Strength Checks
Strength is used for any attempt to move or break something, to jump, climb, or swim beyond your usual physical limits, and to otherwise apply brute force to a situation.

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
When you make an attack roll using a weapon, you add your Strength modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. Some weapons, such as the javelin, can also be thrown to make a ranged attack using Strength.

#### Lifting and Carrying
Your Strength score and modifier are both used to determine how much you can carry.

- Carrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score × 15. This is the weight (in pounds) you can carry as you go about day-to-day business. If you exceed your carrying capacity, you are encumbered.
- Bulky Items. You can carry a number of bulky items equal to 1 + your Strength modifier (minimum 1). If you exceed this number, you are encumbered.
- Supply. You can carry a number of supplies equal to your Strength score in addition to the rest of your gear.
- Drag, Lift, or Push. You can drag, lift, or push up to your Strength score × 30. While moving weight in excess of your carrying capacity you are encumbered.
- Size and Strength. A Tiny creature’s carrying capacity is halved and it can’t carry bulky objects. For each size category above Medium, larger creatures double their carrying capacity, the number of bulky items they can carry, and the amount they can push, drag, or lift.


### Dexterity

#### Dexterity Checks
Dexterity is used for any attempt to balance, move quietly, or to perform tasks focused on deft-fingered movements rather than force.

#### Attack Rolls and Damage
When you make an attack roll using a ranged weapon, you add your Dexterity modifier to the attack roll and the damage roll. When using a melee weapon with the finesse property, you can choose to use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier.

#### Armor Class
The armor you wear determines whether you add any, some, or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.

### Constitution
#### Constitution Checks
Constitution is used for any attempt to physically push beyond normal limits over a period of time.

#### Hit Points
Whenever you increase your hit point maximum when gaining a level or roll Hit Dice to recover hit points, you add your Constitution modifier. When rolling Hit Dice, you add the modifier to each dice roll. If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum also changes as if you always had the new modifier.

### Intelligence

#### Intelligence Checks
Intelligence is frequently used to recall details of the shared adventure world, representing memory and education—knowledge obvious to a character even if unknown or forgotten by their player. It is also used to represent reasoning.

#### Bonus Knowledge
Having a higher Intelligence means having more knowledge than other characters. During character creation, for each point of your Intelligence modifier above 0 you can choose a skill specialty chosen from lore skills (Arcana, Culture, Engineering, History, Nature, Religion). If you are not proficient in any lore skills you instead either gain proficiency with a lore skill, choose an extra language known, or pick a tool proficiency in one artisan’s tool, gaming kit, instrument, or vehicle. If your Intelligence modifier changes, it affects your bonus knowledge. When your Intelligence modifier increases, you can choose an additional skill specialty in the skills listed above as if you always had the new modifier. If your Intelligence modifier decreases you must remove the last benefit from your bonus knowledge. If your Intelligence modifier drops below 0, you don’t lose more knowledge than you gained from bonus knowledge. If you lose bonus knowledge due to a decrease in Intelligence, at the Narrator’s discretion you might choose a new bonus knowledge the next time your Intelligence modifier increases (instead of regaining the lost bonus knowledge).

### Wisdom
#### Wisdom Checks
Wisdom is frequently used to notice details of the shared adventure world immediately around you, representing what you perceive in the moment—the present world obvious to your character as described by the Narrator. It is also used to understand feelings and emotions, and discern cryptic omens on an intuitive rather than logical level.

### Charisma
#### Charisma Checks
Charisma is used in social situations to determine first impressions, to fit in or stand out, and to influence others.

### Working Together
When multiple characters cooperate on a task, one character makes the ability check. They do so with advantage. While in initiative, the Help action is used for cooperative efforts. A character can’t help with a task that they couldn’t attempt alone, or that doesn’t benefit from multiple participants.

### Group Checks
When all individuals in a scene are attempting the same thing as a group, such as climbing a cliff or sneaking up on an enemy camp, the Narrator calls for a group check (described in the Introduction).

### Proficiency Bonus
Every creature has a proficiency bonus determined by its level (for PCs) or its challenge rating (for monsters and most NPCs). The bonus is used for ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws when a creature has a relevant proficiency. When applicable, you add your proficiency bonus to a d20 roll. If two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a roll, you still only add the bonus once. Some rules might modify your proficiency bonus before it is applied to a roll. If multiple rules modify the proficiency bonus in the same way, you still only modify it that way once.

### Saving Throws
A saving throw (sometimes called a save) gives a creature a chance to avoid a threat. You make a saving throw when you’re at risk of harm. Each saving throw is made against a Difficulty Class, which is set by the effect that causes it. Although you typically will not want to, you can always choose to fail a saving throw. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the ability modifier called for by the circumstances as well as any other relevant modifiers. A saving throw can have advantage, disadvantage, or expertise dice applied. All characters, and some monsters, gain saving throw proficiencies. Proficiency in a saving throw for a certain ability lets you add your proficiency bonus to saving throws using that ability. A successful save usually means that a creature avoids or reduces harm, while a failure means that the creature suffers more serious consequences.

### Skills
While abilities provide broad descriptions of a character’s capabilities, a skill represents their training in a particular task such as Acrobatics or Deception. A character who has training in a skill is said to be proficient in it. Most skill proficiencies are acquired by adventurers during character creation from their choice of culture, background, and class.

### Using Skills
When a character attempts an ability check, the Narrator may decide that a specific skill is relevant to the check. If a character is proficient in that skill, they may add their proficiency bonus to their ability check. Any skill can be used with any ability check, although some pairings are more common than others. For instance, the Deception skill is commonly used with Charisma ability checks. Sometimes the Narrator will ask for an ability check using a certain skill. Other times, a Narrator may ask for an ability check, and a player might ask whether one of their skills applies to the check. The Narrator is the sole arbiter of which skill, if any, applies to an ability check. The rules sometimes refer to a check with a skill but no ability specified. This refers to all ability checks using that skill regardless of which ability score is used.

### Skill Specialties
In addition to having proficiency in a skill, a character may be an expert at a narrow area of specialization within that skill. A character gains two skill specialties at 1st level (plus bonus knowledge granted by Intelligence), and gains an additional specialty whenever their proficiency bonus increases (at levels 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level). A character may choose any specialty in a skill in which they are proficient. A character may not gain the same skill specialty twice. When a character makes an ability check to which their skill specialty applies, they gain an expertise die for that ability check. The Narrator determines whether the skill specialty applies. The Narrator may expand the list of skill specialties to meet the needs of the campaign world. Each of its cultures, historical eras, important organizations, and other unique details might furnish a specialty.

### Stealth and Hiding
To attempt to hide from a creature, you must be unseen (behind something, obscured, invisible, or otherwise out of sight) and unheard by that creature, as well as undetected by any other special senses that it might possess. Make a Stealth check. This check’s total is used until you stop hiding or are discovered. If a creature sees you while you are hiding or makes a successful Perception check to locate you, or you make a noise that it can overhear, you are discovered and are no longer hidden from that creature.

These are the skills used in this game.

A single Intimidation check can also be used as part of an interrogation, though further checks rarely offer different results. The GM sets the DC of the check based on the target’s bravery and the circumstances of the check; some creatures can’t be intimidated. The most commonly used ability scores for Intimidation checks are Charisma (for verbal threats) and Strength (for physical threats).
