You’re quite experienced both on land and in the air, be it from time in a navy, as a mercenary, or perhaps even piracy. You gain the following benefits:  Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20. You gain proficiency in the Piloting skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check related to vehicles or ships, you are considered to have expertise in the Investigation or Perception skill.

- Acrobat

If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn’t cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.

- Actor

Prerequisite: 

Skilled at mimicry and dramatics, you gain the following benefits:  Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) and Charisma (Performance) checks when trying to pass yourself off as a different person. You can mimic the speech of another person or the sounds made by other creatures. You must have heard the person speaking, or heard the creature make the sound, for at least 1 minute. A successful Wisdom (Insight) check contested by your Charisma (Deception) check allows a listener to determine that the effect is faked.

- Alert

You master the techniques needed to train and handle animals. You gain the following benefits:  Increase your Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20. You gain proficiency in the Animal Handling skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it. You can use a bonus action on your turn to command one friendly beast within 60 feet of you that can hear you and that isn’t currently following the command of someone else. You decide now what action the beast will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you issue a general command that lasts for 1 minute, such as to guard a particular area.

- Armor Expert

Prerequisite: 

You’ve learned how to fluidly move in armor, gaining the following benefits:  Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20. You gain proficiency with light armor.
