# Astra & Psionics
Astra and Psionics are two different sides to a similar coin. 

## Astra
Astra the Cosmic Resonance. In the boundless tapestry of the cosmos, a mysterious force known as Astra permeates the universe. Comprising the ethereal remnants of long-dead stars and the celestial dust that scatters through the void, Astra is the cosmic lifeblood that flows through all things. It is an enigmatic and potent energy, akin to the mystical Force of ancient tales, defying full comprehension.

Astra is the essence of creation, the cosmic hum that reverberates through space and time. It binds the celestial bodies, weaves the fabric of reality, and dwells within every atom, every breath, every living being. To touch the Astra is to grasp the very essence of existence itself.

Yet, Astra is not easily harnessed. Learning to commune with this primal force, known as Aspecting, is a profound and challenging journey. It requires an attunement to the cosmic symphony, an understanding of the celestial currents, and the patience to listen to the whispers of the stars. Astra is both a source of great power and an ancient enigma, forever entwined with the destiny of those who seek to wield it.

Like electricity, Astra can be measured, siphoned, and potentially even bottled. It is a resource like any other, one only generated by a trained and gifted few a resource that can be used to alter the entropy in a localized area, turning order into chaos (or vice-versa).

It does allow others to measure the amount of astra one possesses or can tap. There are no units of measurement like meters or grams—one simply possesses a quantity of astra, and as they tap that resource, like a muscle, it grows, and one’s source enlarges. In truth, every living creature possess- es astra, but ability to hear its call and wield it is rare. Those that focus their lives to it, however, will be capable of truly remarkable things.

## Psionics
Psionics are the power of the mind. Of will and concentration, of consideration and innovation, of emotion and spirituality. Rather than tap into the Weave or another magical construct, psionic characters and creatures simply will their desires into reality. For some, this will is inherent, innate, and almost impossible to explain to another. Like describing how it feels to breathe in your sleep, your body simply knows what that is like. For others, occult formulae and esoteric mathematics can provide insights into the structure of the mind and how to utilize it.

In Astra Genesis Psionics are generally gained Hosting a symbiote called (Hosting). Some like the Gith are capable of wielding Psionics as well without Hosting. Psionics is tied to Intelligence.
