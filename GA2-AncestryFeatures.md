The only equipment you have is whatever equipment the new body has access to. The GM decides which body you inhabit, and we recommend they choose a body that provides you with an interesting story, or places you in an interesting location where you can soon join back up with your party. Placing a player in the middle of nowhere with no way to get back to the story is not interesting.

If you die, and your bound soul can be recovered, you can be brought back to life. A new snow body must be built for you, using magical ingredients worth 500 gp, and your bound soul must be incorporated into this new body (we assume that the ingredients are common enough that any alchemist or magical shop could provide them). After 24 hours, you come back to life with 1 hit point. This causes strain on your soul, and you take a -4 penalty to attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time you finish a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Immovable Stone. The longer you remain in place, the more like stone you become. At the start of your turn, if you haven’t moved from your current space since the start of your last turn, you grow heavier and sturdier. You reduce any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage you take by 1, to a minimum of 1, as long as you don’t move from that position.
