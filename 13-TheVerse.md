# 13. The 'Verse

```
Game Setting Designer:
This game is a Space Opera setting where we are less concerned about hard scientific data and more concerned about fun gameplay. So distance in this setting is based on Squares (or squares if you like). If you prefer to make numbers correlate to those Squares feel free.

## Factions

### UTE
- **The Emperor**[✪✪✪✪✪]
  - *The Imperator* - Next in line to be the Emperor, only the Emperor knows who this is including the Imperator themselves. The information is stored in "Central" the massive AI that the Empire uses to manage all of its resources and only the Emperor can access who the Imperator is. Upon the Emperor's death the Imperator is called to service and placed in charge their first act is selected a new Imperator.

## Breakdown of the Galactic Scale

### The 'Verse
All known space.

### Region
There are three types of Regions. A region is not a specific size but a descriptive way of explaining what you might find.

#### Realm Space
This is habited, charted, well traveled space. 

#### Free Space
This is largely charted but not unexplored space. Probes, Starstrider long range scans, etc. Has charted this space. Some of it will be habited, some not. This is where the Starstriders Guild comes into play.

#### Wild Space
Uncharted, unknown, unexplored space. Darkness and dangers untold. So far from Realm Space that those who venture here are considered lost.

### Domain
This consists of 4 Sectors, and 64 Subsectors. Domains are unnamed instead they are just numbered. 

This means a Domain consists of almost 17,000 square (41,000 cubic) light-years of space.

### Sector
A sector contains 16 Subsectors. There are about 300-600 systems in a sector. Sectors are named such as The Illusia Sector, or The Bastion Sector.

### Subsector
The standard for the Starstriders guild is the Subsector. 16 per sector with the average containing 30-60 systems per subsector. Subsectors are always named such as The Calvaknie Subsector.

Subsectors are generally the "Fleet Level" and in the UTE they assign a Fleet Admiral to oversee a Subsector as well as a Governor with each colony getting a Lt.Governor and each system being assigned a Local Fleet under an Admiral, Vice Admiral or for especially small Colonies a Commodore. 

> Setting Designer
> Subsectors are 80 square parsecs in size
> A single hex represents a Systems size, with 1 parsec between each Hex. 
> This comes from Cepheus. It is also one of the more elegant galacic mapping solutions

### Quadrant
This consist of 1/4 of a Sector and 4 Subsectors. Quadrants are numbered 1-4.

### System
A system is a measurement for a Solar System. A system is always named after the prvailing species or most interesting world. Such as the Kavian System which is named for Kavian III.

It consists of at least 1 Star or other phenomena to make it interesting.

Typically a System is made up of several planets orbiting one or more stars in Zones. Planets and stellar bodies are named after the System and then numbered in order from the Star, satelites like moons are assigned an alphabetically assignment for closest to furthest or first discovered if the same distance. Moons are only detailed in a solar system chart if they are relevant.

For Earth's Solar System:

(Sol)

- .Sol I - Mercury
- ..Sol II - Venus
- ...Sol III - Earth
- ....Sol IIIa - Luna
- .....Sol IV - Mars

- ..............Sol VIIIa - Triton
- ..............Sol VIIIb - Despina
- ...............Sol IX - Devris
- ................Sol X - Eris
- .................Sol XI - Pluto
- ..................Sol XII - Warp Gate to Azaran


### Zone

- Near: Closest to the star, this is bombarded with so much heat and radiation from the system’s star that it will never support life
- Inner System: Typically too hot for habitable worlds to form, usually Terrestrial rocks, and Jovian Gas Giants
- Habitable Zone: Theoretically, a habitable world could be in this zone.
- Outer System: Typically too cold for a habitable world, usually Terestrial Rocks, and Jovian Ice Giants this generally consits of 3 zones
- Far: Everything beyond Outer. Anything in the star’s Far region suffers from the frigid conditions of being so far away from the star and could never support life

### Mapping the Galaxy

The mapping system uses the Starstriders Guild GPS or Galactic Profile System.

It is a series of numbers and letters.

0-9, A-Z where 1+ is valid and 0 is a null or empty value.

000 0000  0000  000000000 0

123-456-789A-BCDEFGHIJK-

The first 20 characters are Stellar Data. Or the GSP (Galactic System Profile)

1. Domain of system 1-Z
2. Sector of system 1-4
3. Subsector of system 1-F (inside the sector)
4. Coordinate 1 in Subsector
5. Coordinate 2 in Subsector
6. Coordinate 3 in Subsector
7. Coordinate 4 in Subsector
8. Number of Stars in System
9. Primary Star Type: O, B, A, F, G, K, L, M
10. Age of star
11. Luminosity of star 0 [0], 1 [Ia0], 2 [Ia], 3 [Ib],4 [II], 5 [III], 6 [IV], 7 [V], 8 [VI], 9 [VII]
12. Near zone objects
13. Inner zone objects
14. Habitable Zone Objects
15. Outer Zone 1 Objects
16. Outer Zone 2 Objects
17. Outer Zone 3 Objects
18. Far Zone 1 Objects
19. Far Zone 2 Objects
20. Far Zone 3 Objects

The next 18 are Planetary Data, if it is a habited world it will likely have all 15. A habitable but uninhabited world will likely only have 8 or so.

1. Zone - 1 [N], 2 [I], 3 [H], 4 [O1], 5 [O2], 6 [O3], 7 [F1], 8 [F2], 9 [F3]
2. Orbit Number

   3. Atmostpheric conditions
   4. Hydrographics - this will be present only if the world is inhabited
   5. Population - this will be present only if the world is inhabited
   6. Government - this will be present only if the world is inhabited
   7. Law Level - this will be present only if the world is inhabited
   8. Tech Level - this will be present only if the world is inhabited [1-E]
