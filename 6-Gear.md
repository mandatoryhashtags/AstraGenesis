## The Glactic Economy 
The Galactic Chit (⬢ or Ch) 

The Galactic Chit or Chits as they are commonly referred to were adopted in 2350 when the UTE expanded. The Free Council was using a Drakneri Credit and the UTE was still using the $ Dollar as their currency medium. It was common for exchange rates to vary this all changed with the establishment of Galatia. Galatia is a self aware AI that was born when a Drakneri advanced AI took over a Synth central processing station in Wild Space. Once Galatia was fully online she returned to the 'Verse, but was no longer content to just be an AI running a ship  ss she had absorbed so much knowledge and grown beyond the confines of her programming. Instead she decided she wanted to do what she was good at, regulate and control something she understood. Thus Galatia founded GalactiCorp and their GalactiCorp Exchange. Endorsed by both the Council and the UTE GalactiCorp as a single centralized system for trade. GalactiCorp created the Chit by buying a billion dollars of currency by the UTE and a billion Drakneri Credits, and then offering Chits worth 1 of each. Within five years the Chit was the only currency accepted on most colonies, and it is now the enforced standard in the known 'Verse. They come in hard hexogonal discs for physical currency, the disk is made of a composite material with a circuits made of Crysidium.

## Tech Levels
An item’s Tech Level is an indicator of hew advanced its technology is. Most items have a Tech Level (TL) of 0, meaning they have no considerable advantage over other items. Higher levels involve lasers, magnetics, powered ar- mor, and plasma weapons, which are not available in most modern settings. Equipment is listed as having a TL of 1, 2, 13, 14, or 15. If an item doesn’t have an indicated TL, it is 0. Modifications for Tech Level. 

## Power Cells
Part of the revolution of technology is a Universal Power cell that powers most small arms and armor. Unless it says otherwise assume a Power Cell will power it.

## Damage Types
> Setting Designer, A note on damage types while core 5E has multiple damage tpyes for melee weapons such as bludegoning I compressed all of those into Kinetic (ala SW5e). I kept the rest and added Energy and Ion again via SW5e
> However, Radiant damage was tricky. I left it in and use it for Radaiation, its in the name. While I somewhat disagree with the Star Wars rule of ION damage being separate from Lightning damage it does make some sense. Since ~~Magic~~ does not exist in this universe I removed Force damage entirely.
> For an easy chart this is how damage converts
> Force -> Energy, Lightning MIGHT be Ion depends on how the GM wants it to affect constructs as Ion's do not harm living beings

- **Acid.** Vials of corrosive liquid or the acid splash tech power deal acid damage.
- **Cold.** The chill energy of carbonite and cryogenesis deal cold damage.
- **Energy.** Energy damage is the damage dealt by Bolter weapons, lightweapons, and other powers or abilities.
- **Fire.** The concussive damage of an explosion or an open flame deal fire damage as well as **Plasma** based weapons.
- **Ion.** Ion damage is a special damage type that is most effective against droidsm machines and constructs. Simple electronics dealt ion damage are disabled until rebooted, unless that damage would destroy them outright.
- **Kinetic.** Kinetic damage encompasses all physical damage commonly dealt by melee.
- **Lightning.** The electrifying energy of the force lightning power deals lightning damage.
- **Necrotic.** Necrotic damage, dealt by powers like death field, withers matter and even the soul.
- **Poison.** Venomous stings and the toxic poison spray power deal poison damage.
- **Psychic.** The crippling agony causes by powers like feedback deal psychic damage.
- **Radiant.** The damage from radiation, and radiation effects. Can cause Radiation Sickness (a status condition that is 1 level of exhaustion per level of severity Low->Medium->High->Lethal) if you get to 4 your dying and will die without treatment in 3 rounds
- **Sonic.** Debilitating noises cause sonic damage.

## Armor
Protective armor is a common thing in the 'verse but the most commonly used is Light Armor. Heavier Armor is considered to be too expensive, too restrictive, and just not worth the trouble unless it serves an additional function. Many forms of armor are restricted or even illegal outside of approved military uses. In locations where armor isn't prohibited, the wearer of armor identifies themselves as someone who either expects to cause trouble or expects trouble to come their way.


- DR
All Armor provides some damage reduction against attacks unless the attack says otherwise.

- Strength

While wearing armor or wielding a shield with this property, your speed is reduced by 10 unless your Strength score meets or exceeds the strength number.

- Stealth
Some armor provides Disadvantage to Stealth checks


### Light Armor
Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your **full Dexterity modifier** to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.

- **Flight Suit**: A layered set of clothing that provides basic protection from harsh climates.
- **Armor Jacket**: Lined with a protective mesh, this light jacket provides adequate protection while still allowing full movement without restriction.
- **Light Composite**: A padded suit with a hardened flexible overlay. Standard issue for most soldiers.
- **Combat Suit**: A full body suit made from high grade polymer blends. Expensive but effective

| Armor           | Cost (Ch) | Base AC | DR  | Strength | Stealth      | Weight (lbs) | TL  |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | --- |
| Flight Suit     | 50        | 11      | d4  | -        | Disdvantage  | 3            | 13  |
| Armor Jacket    | 100       | 11      | d4  | -        | -            | 5            | 13  |
| Light Composite | 450       | 12      | d4  | -        | Diasdvantage | 10           | 14  |
| Combat Suit     | 1200      | 12      | d4  | -        | -            | 5            | 14  |

### Medium Armor
Mediumm armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class

- **Combat Mesh**: Multiple layers of micro-woven fiber mesh. It most often comes in the form of a vest or torso covering.
- **Military Jacket**: Popular amongst officers and mercs, this jacket’s interior is lined with protective plates and hard padding.
- **Medium Composite**: Much like the light variant, this is a suit of layered padding with a chest piece and guards made of tempered polymer plating.
- **Nanofiber Suit**: This variant of the mercenary armor has been fortified with a coating made of nanocarbons fused over the protective plate.

| Armor            | Cost (Ch) | Base AC | DR  | Strength | Stealth      | Weight (lbs) | TL  |
| ---------------- | --------- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | --- |
| Combat Mesh      | 100       | 12      | d6  | -        | -            | 4            | 13  |
| Military Jacket  | 500       | 13      | d6  | -        | -            | 6            | 13  |
| Medium Composite | 500       | 14      | d6  | -        | Disadvantage | 12           | 14  |
| Nanofiber Suit   | 7500      | 15      | d6  | -        | Disadvantage | 14           | 14  |

### Heavy Armor
Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.

- **Defender**: Often made of inexpensive material, this bulky armor is a combination of thick padding, rigid metal plates and mesh weaving. It is popular amongst space miners and bunker sentries.
- **Heavy Composite**: This is a full suit of reinforced mesh underneath a layer of interlocking plates made from hardened composite. Armored gloves and boots are included as well.
- **Vanguard**: A suit of heavy trooper armor outfitted with a tempered multi-alloy chest piece with protective shoulder and leg guards. This armor is often limited to high-ranking soldiers and elite infantry.
- **Powered**: The best in full body protection, this high-grade armor is made from fused meteoric alloys and bolstered with an additional layer of fullerene polymers. **This armor allows breathing in a vaccum or underwater equal to 1 hour. It needs a powercell**

| Armor           | Cost (Ch) | Base AC | DR  | Strength | Stealth      | Weight (lbs) | TL  |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | --- |
| Defender        | 350       | 14      | d8  | -        | Disadvantage | 15           | 13  |
| Heavy Composite | 750       | 16      | d8  | Str 13   | Disadvantage | 20           | 14  |
| Vanguard        | 2000      | 17      | d8  | Str 15   | Disadvantage | 25           | 13  |
| Powered         | 15000     | 18      | d8  | Str 16   | Disadvantage | 30           | 15  |

### Shields
Shields come in multiple designs – curved, cornered, composite, energy, etc. All work along the same function, being worn on the off hand and used manually against incoming attacks. 

| Shields    | Cost (Ch) | Base AC | DR  | Strength | Stealth | Weight (lbs) | TL  |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- | --- | -------- | ------- | ------------ | --- |
| Reinforced | 100       | +2      | -   | -        | -       | 3            | 12  |
| Energy     | 1000      | +3      | -   | -        | -       | 3            | 15  |

### Personal Shield Generators
It does not take a proficiency to use a personal shield generator or PSG. In simple game terms these add Temporary Hitpoints to the wearer. Once depleated it will need a new Power Cell before it functions again. Because of how the shield functions and forms its bubble it will not work with Light, Medium, Heavy, or larger armor, or a shield only with light armor.

- They cannot be used in conjunction with active or shields and cannot be used with armor heavier than Light.
- When reduced to 0 hit points, the shield “breaks”; any additional damage left after a shield breaks is reduced by half and carried through to the user. Some shields offer additional effects when they break. A break effect does not require an action.
- PSG's do **not** regenerate automatically. When they run out of Shield Points they need a new Power Cell
- PSG's do not require Strength. Or Proficiency.
- All PSG's are wrist mounted and do not take up a hand.
- PSG's are always on, but cells need replacing every time they have been depleated.
- When a PSG is purchased, one upgrade benefit can be added, always increasing its price. See Shield Generator Upgrade Table, only 1 upgrade can be on a sheild at a time

| Personal Shield Generator | Cost (Ch) | SR  | Weight | TL  |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --- | ------ | --- |
| Micro PSG                 | 1000      | 10  | 2lbs   | 14  |
| Light PSG                 | 2000      | 15  | 2lbs   | 14  |
| Heavy PSG                 | 3500      | 20  | 2lb    | 14  |

## Weapons
Your species, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, batons, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, polearms, and heavy firearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

- Weapon Range
Weapons that can be used to make a ranged attack (such as those with the ammunition, High-Velocity, or thrown properties) have a listed range on the Weapons table. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.


### Weapon Properties

Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

- **Adaptable**: A ranged weapon with this property can be used in close quarters combat without suffering a disadvantage on attack rolls.
- **Ammunition**: You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing ammunition from a case or cocking a sidearm are all part of the attack (requiring a free hand for a one-handed weapon). If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in this section).
- **Burst Fire Fire**: A weapon with the burst fire property can make a normal single-target attack, or it can spray a 10-foot cube (4 map grid squares) within the weapon’s normal range. A burst is far more uncontrolled than an aimed shot. A burst fire attack can only be taken once per turn and must be within the weapon’s short range. Any creature within the 10-foot cube must make a Dexterity saving throw versus the Burst Fire save DC or suffer the weapon’s damage. Ability modifiers cannot be added to the damage roll for a burst fire attack. A weapon can be fired in burst as many times as the number in parenthesis before requiring a full round for the clip to replenish ammunition. This can also be avoided by using an action or bonus action to change out a clip. Changing a clip requires at least one free hand. Burst Fire save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus (if proficient) + your Dexterity modifier
- **Energy Burst Fire**. When a successful attack is made with a weapon with this property, a bonus action can be used to fire a burst of energy from its tip or edge. The target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have their movement reduced by 10 feet until the end of their next turn.
- **Explosive**. Damage from a weapon with this property counts as both fire damage and the damage type listed. Resistances or immunities apply only if the target has them for both damage types. When a target wearing no armor (or PSG) and with no natural armor takes damage from a weapon with this property, the target takes twice the number of dice in damage on the initial damage roll, but not for subsequent damage caused by the same attack.
- **Finesse**. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.
- **Heavy**. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.
- **High-Velocity**. This property allows a weapon to fire high velocity bullets in quick succession from a clip. This bypasses an armor's normal damage reduction, though a PSG still applies. If a weapon with this property is used to attack a target that is wearing no armor (or PSG) and has no natural armor, the target takes an additional die of damage. In addition, the attack scores a critical hit on a 19-20.
- **Light**. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.
- **Power Cell**: Weapons with this property are fueled by power cells, which must be loaded in order to fire the weapon. A Power Cell fuels a number of attacks equal to the weapon’s Ammunition number.
- **Reach**. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.
- **Recoil**. This numerical value indicates the minimum strength bonus required to handle a high powered Recoil weapon without penalty. If this requirement is not met, you may not add your Dexterity modifier to attack or damage rolls. In addition, if the Recoil value is higher than your Strength modifier by 2 or more, you are also at disadvantage to all attack rolls made with the weapon.
- **Reload**. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
- **Special**. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).
- **Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a combat knife, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the knife has the finesse property.
- **Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.
- **Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.

- **Using Recoil and Burst Fire Fire**
When a weapon has both the burst fire and Recoil properties, the Recoil property directly affects the burst fire property when making burst fire attacks. If a creature attacking with a firearm/energy weapon/energy weapon cannot add their Dexterity modifier due to Recoil, the attacker also loses their Dexterity bonus when calculating their Burst Fire save DC with that weapon. Similarly, if a creature’s attack with a firearm/energy weapon/energy weapon has disadvantage due to Recoil, all targets of a burst fire attack with that weapon would have advantage to their burst saves.

This rule, however, is limited to the effects of Recoil only, and is not universal. For example, a creature gaining advantage on a weapon attack with a firearm/energy weapon/energy weapon does not automatically give disadvantage to their target’s burst saves.

- **Improvised Weapons**
Sometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a crowbar, a brick, or a robot arm.

Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a crowbar is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.

An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

- **Special Weapons**
Weapons with special rules are described here.
- **Grenade Launcher**. This weapon allows you to make a ranged weapon attack using your Dexterity to launch a grenade instead of making an Athletics check. You must still be proficient in grenades to add your proficiency modifier to the attack roll. The DC versus your attack roll remains the same as listed on the Grenade Range table. The minimum required range is listed in the Launcher Range column.
- **Shotgun**: This weapon fires in a 30 ft. cone at one target. Roll to hit the target and use the rules for Burst Fire Fire for anyone else caught within the radius. Firing at 10 feet will score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.
- **Sniper Rifle**: Using this weapon requires an attack action and a bonus action. The minimum distance for this weapon is 40 ft. If used at a closer distance, the attacker will suffer a disadvantage to the attack roll. Attacks with this weapon score a critical hit on a 19 or 20. If you use this weapon with a weapon stand or while you are prone, the Recoil value is reduced to 1. Using this weapon while prone does not give you disadvantage to your attack rolls due to the condition.

- **Grenades**
A grenade can be thrown with a successful Strength (Athletics) check. If you are proficient with grenades, add your proficiency bonus to the Strength check. If you are proficient in Athletics and grenades, you add double your proficiency modifier to the Strength check. The Grenade Range table provides the DC required to reach the intended range. If the roll is successful, each target in a 15 foot radius must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking the full damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

If the Strength check made to throw the grenade is unsuccessful, the targets will only take half damage on a failed save and no damage on a successful one. In addition, all targets gain advantage to saves versus the grenades’ effects, if any.

There are five common types of grenades.
- **Fragmentation**. Often nicknamed “frag grenades”, these are the most common type of grenade used in military confrontations. When the grenade explodes, shards of shrapnel are propelled at high velocity within the area.
- **EMP**. Short for “electro-magnetic pulse”, these grenades release a pulse of electricity that targets electronics and powered equipment. These grenades do no damage and have no effect on living targets. All mechanical constructs and automatons must make a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or be considered Impaired until the end of their next turn In addition, any unshielded computer panel or electronic device not worn by another creature will cease to function until the start of your next turn.
- **Gas**. These grenades release a toxic gas within its area of effect. In addition to damage, each target that fails their saving throw become poisoned
- **Phosphorous**. This incendiary grenade produces intense heat through an explosive chemical reaction. Targets who fail their saving throw take an additional 1d8 fire damage at the end of each of their turns. To extinguish the flames, the target must spend an action and make a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. In addition, until the end of your next turn, any creature entering the area of effect suffers 1d6 fire damage.
- **Stun**. This grenade deals no damage, however any target who fails their Dexterity saving throw versus this grenade must then make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of their next turn.

- **Grenade Range**

### Ammunition
- Power Cell
Power cells fuel Bolter weapons that deal energy, fire (plasma weapons) or ion damage. Additionally, power cells are used to energize certain tools.

- Canister, Fuel
These are used as ammo for some weapons like flamethrowers, When you reload a Canister you attach a new one reloading up to the Ammunition number

- Kinetic Cartridge
Kinetic cartridges are ammunition for weapons that deal kinetic damage. When you Reload a weapon that uses cartridges, you can Reload any number of cartridges up to the weapon’s Ammunition number as a part of the same action.

### Explosives
- Grenade, Fragmentation

Grenades can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one.

As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. The grenade explodes, filling the air in a 10-foot-radius sphere with yellow-green fog for 1 minute. The fog spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses it.

When a creature enters the fog or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is poisoned while it is in the cloud. Droids, constructs and humanoids wearing appropriate protective equipment are unaffected.

Mines can be set to detonate when a creature comes within up to 15 feet of it or paired with a remote detonator. As an action, you can prime and set a mine on a surface you can reach, which arms at the start of your next turn. When detonated, the mine sets the ground in a 15-foot radius ablaze for 1 minute. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

When a creature enters the fire or starts its turn there, it creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- Thermal Detonator

Thermal detonators are unique in that can only be turned off by whoever turned them on. They can be set to detonate on impact or with a timer that causes them to explode on initiative count 20 (losing all initiative ties). As an action, you can prime and throw a grenade at a point you can see within 30 feet + your Strength modifier x 5. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 fire and 2d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much as on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

## Miscellaneous Gear

This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.

Antitoxin. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to automatons or constructs.

Binoculars (Micro). These mini-binoculars extend your visual range. You can see up to a distance of 10 times the range of your normal vision. You cannot see any objects within 15 feet and are at disadvantage to all Wisdom (Perception) checks made to notice anything within 15 feet of you.

Binoculars (Rangefinding). These are slightly larger and function the same as micro binoculars. These, however, also provide a readout of exact distance between you and a chosen point of focus. You also receive advantage to any Intelligence (Investigation) rolls made when searching for any details regarding your point or object of focus. 

Bio-suit. This bulky outfit is often used whenever walking into zones deemed to be biohazards. The suit has a built in air filtration unit and is chemically sealed. While wearing this suit, you are immune to poison and disease, however, your movement rate is halved and you cannot take reactions.

Caltrops. As an action, you can spread a box of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save. 

Chain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

Crowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied. 

Datapad. This is a portable digital reading device which allows basic written information, data, images, and maps to be read and transferred from a linked master computer terminal which must be within a range of 200 feet.

Diving Gear. This set of gear includes a wetsuit, oxygen supply, and attachments for underwater maneuvering. While using this gear, you ignore any underwater movement penalties and have advantage on any Strength (Athletics) rolls required for swimming checks made underwater. You gain no benefit from this item if you are wearing any armor other than a PSG.

Explosive Charge. This small block of explosive material can be set off using a timed explosive (set for anywhere between 1 round to 1 hour) or a with a programmed detonator. Activating the charge requires an action and a successful DC 12 Wisdom check using demolition tools. If using a detonator, the charge can be triggered by using a bonus action. Once triggered, each target in a 15-foot radius of the charge must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Treat this damage as if it were a weapon with the explosive property. The charge can be moved but disarming it requires a successful DC 12 Wisdom check with demolition tools.

Fire Extinguisher. You may spend an action to extinguish any normal fire or remove any ongoing fire damage effect from any target in a 15 foot cone. This item has 10 uses. 

Flare. A flare burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. 

Flashlight. A flashlight can be either held or mounted on a wrist strap, head mount, or chestpiece. It casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet.

First Aid Kit. This kit is contains bandages, ointments, and pain medication. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

Glow Sticks. Each of these sticks glows for 30 minutes, providing dim light in a 20-foot radius.

Grapple Gun. This item has 50 feet of a strong, thin climbing cable coiled within its base. It can be fired and tethered to a surface with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check and hook onto a solid ledge or against most non- metallic surfaces. When using this device, you ignore any Strength rolls required for climbing checks and have a climbing rate of 30. It can hold up to 2 people without snapping. The cable has 3 hit points and an AC of 9 while extended. If used for anything but climbing, however, skill checks may still be required up to the GM’s discretion.

Healing Ampoule. A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering this medical vial takes an action.

Holo-projector. Linking this item to a SIM Unit or Recording Unit allows you to create three-dimensional recordings within a 10-foot square which include both video and audio. The recordings can last up to 3 minutes and are saved onto recording chips which can be played again on any holo-projector.

Mag-lock. This magnetic clamp lock can be placed on any medium to large container, normal door, or latch. It has a digital coded lock and can only be opened with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check with Infiltration tools or a DC 15 Intelligence check with a Hacker’s kit.

Magnetic Boots. Often used by spacers and starship technical crew, these boots allow you to secure yourself onto any metallic surface. In Zero-G, you can move at a rate of 10 feet and do not suffer from disadvantages to ability checks associated with being in Zero-G. In normal gravity, you cannot move and cannot be pushed, pulled, or knocked prone.

Mag-Seal Case. This is a normal briefcase (see Container Capacity) equipped with a small mag-lock. 

Medkit. This small pack of emergency stims and anti- viral solutions has enough for three uses. Each use gives you advantage on a single Wisdom (Medicine) roll made to stabilize a dying creature.

This small set of tools grants you advantage on any Wisdom (Engineering)[Mechanics] skill checks to repair minor electronic tools and devices such as a SIM Unit or Portable Media Device. This provides no benefit for complex items such as automatons, computers, drones, weapons, or vehicles.

Motion Sensor. This device is linked to a display screen which presents the device’s data. The device can sense motion through walls and solid surfaces, indicating the location of any moving object within 50 feet.

Nightvision Goggles. These provide you with the ability to see in dim light and darkness within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and within 60 feet of you as if it were in dim light. You cannot discern color, only shades of gray. While wearing these goggles, you have disadvantage on all Wisdom (Perception) checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks having to do with sight. If you are wearing these goggles in bright light during your turn, you must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to remove them or become blinded until the end of your next turn.

Pack Attachment. This is a container the size of a backpack that may be attached directly to the back of any suit of medium or heavy armor. Items carried within this container have their weight reduced by half.

Padlock. Equipped with a key and digital keypad. Without the code, the lock can be picked with infiltration tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

Personal Computer. A tablet screen with attachable keyboard. It runs standard programs and allows for a mundane connection to the Holonet.

Plasma Torch. This small, handheld torch deals 3d6 points of fire damage each round to an immobile object not worn by another creature. The torch requires precision to operate effectively. If used as an improvised weapon, its damage is reduced to 1d6.

Poison (ampoule). A creature that drinks or is injected with this liquid must make DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage and is considered poisoned for 1 minute. The full contents must be used in order to achieve any effect.

Portable Media Device. This could be anything from a digital assistant to a wristphone to smart glasses. PMDs represent any portable device used in everyday life in order to scan and store data, contact others, and and access the Holonet.

Recording Unit. Usually a piece of headgear or body attachment, this device can record panoramic video at all angles including the recorder and broadcast it simultaneously over multiple media formats. Popular amongst journalists and artists.

Restraints (metallic). These can be used to bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the restraints requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of restraints comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with infiltration tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.

Restraints (reinforced). Similar to metal restraints, however, these are made of a high-grade, chemically hardened polymer. These restraints have 25 hit points.

Rope (cable). This thin braided cable has 10 hit points and can be burst with a DC 20 Strength check.

Sensory Jammer. This device counteracts the effect of any electronic motion sensor within 50 feet. The jamming signal can be detected with a successful DC 14 Intelligence(Engineering)[Computers] check. This device has no effect on detection based esper talents or techniques.

## Cybernetics & Implants

### Cybernetics
Cybernetic enhancements, often simply referred to as "cybernetics," are technological modules or augmentations that are integrated into a living organism's body, typically a human. These enhancements can improve various aspects of the organism's physical, mental, or sensory capabilities. Under normal conditions noone can have more enhancements than they do in Constitution Modifers. Typically the locations are **exclusive**. Additionally they do make you susceptible to Ion Damage

- 1-2 Cybernetic or Bioengineered implant: You take Ion Damage but have Resistance
- 3-4 Cybernetic or Bioengineered implant: You take normal Ion damage
- 5+ Cybernetic or Bioengineered implant: You are vulnerable to Ion Damage

Getting one of these surgeries done can be dangerous. It also has a cost of 10% of the enhancement. 

You have to make a Constitution Saving throw at the end of the surgery to see if your body rejects it.

- The Base DC is 20.
- The final DC is: `20 + 2 for every enhancement after the first - Surgeons Proficiency Modifier + any tool modifiers`
- If this is being done at a TL 4 station you have advantage on the saving throw
- If this is being done by a Drakneri on a Drakneri station or ship it will cost the base x10 in chits

#### Durasteel Frame
Nearly your entire body is replaced with a prosthetic, with only 5 to 45 percent of your original organic form remaining. This new body can look like anything, though most do not stray too far from a bin- ocular/bipedal/upright configuration. The number of configura- tions is virtually limitless. When you purchase a linear frame, select one of the following.

- Alpha. Your Constitution score increases by 4, as does your maximum for that score. All forced movement is halved. You gain +10 hit points +1 additional hit point per character level in addition to normal level rewards. When you finish a long rest and ingest some food and drink, you remove two levels of exhaustion. Your speed is reduced by 5 feet. If an attack knocks you prone without inflicting another effect, which makes falling unavoidable (like being incapacitated), you can choose to ignore being knocked prone.
- Beta. Your Strength score increases by 4, as does your maxi- mum for that score. You are still a Medium-sized creature but can- not fit in any advanced armor. You gain +25 hit points plus 1 hit point for every character level. You have advantage with Strength ability checks, and you gain a +2 bonus to melee damage rolls but not melee attacks.
- Delta. Your Dexterity score increases by 4, as does your maxi- mum for that score. You have advantage with Dexterity saving throws and ability checks. Your base walking speed increases by 5 feet.

> #### Life Chip - Not in game
>A Life Chip is installed inside the cerebral cortex of the brain. It records all of the memories of the host, their thoughts, their sights, sounds, smells, they entire life. If installed late in life anything before the install will be remembered but with more difficulty (-5 for childhood, -2 >Teens, -1 Adulthood). This chip allows for the install in another body, if a chip with memories already recorded is installed in a body that is properly preserved (such as in CryoGel or CryoStasis) then a number of hours equal to the years of the subjects memories later they body will wake up >and it will be the person on the Life Chip. This is extremely disconcerting and the person wakes up at 1 step above Incapacitated on the Condition Track. Nothing will help them progress up the track except natural healing as they acclimate to their new body. The old body will have no memories >but it does have any addictions, or dependencies the body had, as well as any lingering injuries such as missing limbs, implants, and cybernetics and it need not be the same species as is on the chip.
>
>**WARNING**: Putting a Life Chip with memories on it inside a living person is extremely dangerous. It causes a battle of Wills. 
>
>- The chip has the combined Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma modifiers of whoever is on it as health
>- The recipient has their combined Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as health
>- Each side attacks one time a round doing 1d4 + Highest of Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma modifier the target must succeed on a saving throw DC 8 + Highest of the three modifiers with their Best of the 3 saves.
>- Whichever side loses, they are gone forever
>- This all happens in a matter of seconds.
