  - If does not recharge
  - When it runs out of Shield Points it will need a new Power Cell to function again
  - **Critcally important: These shields do not apply to melee weapons, they are moving too slow**

> SETTING DESIGNER
> So the entire reason that Personal Shield Generators were created was to deal with High Velocity weapons. This led to a renewed interest in melee combat skills.
> When fighting someone behind a powerful PSG ... they are only wearing light or no armor. This makes a Warbringer especially frightening in the 'Verse
