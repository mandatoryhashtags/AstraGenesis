## Hazards

### Poisons and Toxins
Given their deadly nature, poisons are treated as illegal substances in most parts of the galaxy but still remain a popular item in underworld markets.

Poisons come in the following four types.

- Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

- Ingested. A creature must swallow or be injected with an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food, drink, or by ampoule injection. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

- Inhaled. These poisons are toxic chemical powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. 

Atmospheric Toxicity from planets falls under Inhaled as well

- Injury. Injury poison is harmful when it contacts a creature’s bloodstream. They can applied to weapons, needles, darts, and other sharp objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

Each type of poison has its own debilitating effects.

- Atmospheric Toxicity (Inhaled). A creature subjected to the atmosphere of a toxic planet is exposed to a toxic gas, the severity depends on the planet.
  - Trace. DC 13 Con sve or Poisoned for 1 minute
  - Moderate. DC 15 Con save or Poisoned for 1 hour
  - Severe. DC 15 Con save. On a fail poisoned for 8 hours and take 2d6 points of Poison damage save for half
  - Deadly. DC 20 Con save. On a fail Poisoned for 24 hours, and take 6d6 points of Poison damage, save for half

- Arsenic (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 7 (2d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 24 hours. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn’t poisoned.

- Blue Mercury (Contact). A creature subjected to this toxin must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage.

- Chloral Hydrate (Ingested). A creature subjected to this toxin must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 4d6 hours. The poisoned creature is incapacitated.

- Cyanide (Ingested). A creature that ingests this poison must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (7d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- Knockout Gas (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this toxin must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 8 hours. The poisoned creature is unconscious. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

- Nerve Gas (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this toxin must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage, and must repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On each successive failed save, the character takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. After three successful saves, the effects of the toxin ends.

- Quantum Burn (Injury). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (9d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- Sethari Blight (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated Sethari stinger. A creature subjected to this poison must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- Enteria Saliva (Ingested). This poison is harvested from Enteria snappers. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage and become poisoned. The poisoned creature must repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) poison damage on a failed save. Until this poison ends, the damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means. After seven successful saving throws, the effect ends and the creature can heal normally.

- Tear Gas (Inhaled). A creature subjected to this toxin must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature is blinded.

- Tetrodotoxin (Contact). This toxic secretion is often harvested from particular sea creatures. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature remains under the effect for 3 minutes or more, it starts to suffocate.

- Truth Serum (Ingested). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. The poisoned creature can’t knowingly speak a lie, as if under the effect of the detect truth power.

- Ves'kari Venom (Injury). This poison must be harvested from a dead or incapacitated Ves'kari warrior. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Radiation Exposure
Radiation exposure can occur whenever a character spends time in an irradiated area or comes into close proximity to a source of radiation, such as an unsealed biohazard container or a leaking containment core. Radiation can also come from natural sources like certain stars and celestial bodies.

| Radiation Level | Save DC | Exposure Period |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------- |
| Minor           | 10      | 1 hour          |
| Severe          | 15      | 1 minute        |
| Deadly          | 20      | 1 round         |

- Contracting Radiation Sickness. Creatures exposed to radiation may become afflicted with radiation sickness. Contracting this sickness is dependent upon the length and level of exposure to a source of radiation.

Different sources of radiation have varying levels of intensity. The following are some examples: 

**Minor** forms of radiation can come from Tiny or Small irradiated objects such as a vehicle’s fuel cell or a meteorite.

**Severe** radiation levels can be encountered by direct contact with a Large or larger source of radioactive material or wandering through an area with a nearby collection of irradiated objects.

**Deadly** levels of radiation can come from being blasted with intense gamma rays or being in an area flooded with radioactive gas.

When a creature is exposed to a radiation source, they must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they contract radiation sickness. Consult the Radiation Exposure table to determine the DC for the save. Creatures resistant to disease have advantage to this saving throw, while those immune to disease automatically succeed.

The character may have to repeat their saving throw depending upon how long the character stays in contact with the irradiated source, as represented on the table. For example, an engineer is exploring uncharted caverns on a remote planet. The glowing flora that grows all about the cavern emits severe levels of radiation. Every minute spent within the cavern, the engineer must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become afflicted with radiation sickness.

A character that contracts radiation sickness acquires it at a degree which corresponds with the level of radiation to which they were exposed. For example, the engineer exposed to severe levels of radiation would contract severe radiation sickness.

| Degree | Save DC | Necrotic Damage |
| ------ | ------- | --------------- |
| Minor  | 10      | 1d6             |
| Severe | 15      | 2d6             |
| Deadly | 20      | 3d6             |

Spending a long rest in a medbay or regeneration pod
removes the sickness

## Tracked Conditions
> Setting Designer
> Exhaustion is gone. Using LevelUp's much more elegant Fatigue and Strife system.

### Fatigue
Keeping a breakneck pace while journeying, feats of great athleticism, and fell magics that sap away life force can wear down upon the body and cause fatigue. Fatigue represents exhaustion, exposure, hunger, injuries, and other physical factors which gradually wear a creature down. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the fatigue track becomes doomed and dies.

| Level | Effects                                                                                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Cannot Sprint                                                                              |
| 2     | Disadvantage on Str, Dex, and Con checks                                                   |
| 3     | Speed halved and unable to maintain a fast travel pace                                     |
| 4     | Disadvantage on attacks and saves using Str, Dex, or Con, and unable travel at normal pace |
| 5     | Hit Dice halved                                                                            |
| 6     | Speed reduced to 5 ft. and unable to maintain a slow travel pace                           |
| 7     | Doomed                                                                                     |

### Strife
Intense study of potent astra, truly rigorous intellectual challenges, and psychically demanding astra rituals can increase one’s strife. Strife represents corruption, despair, fear, loss of resolve, and other mental factors which gradually undo a creature’s very soul. A creature which reaches the 7th level of the strife track suffers a special, permanent effect, which is either randomly selected or decided by the Narrator. This might involve the creature shutting down completely, or being impacted in such a way that it is forever changed.

#### Mental Stress Effects
Adventurers encounter and even seek out experi-
ences beyond the ken of most mortals. Whether it’s
harrowing encounters with interdimensional beings,
the sudden, violent loss of a beloved NPC, or simply
the trauma of constantly being surrounded by death
and terror, their lows can be as dramatic and poten-
tially impactful as their highs.

The rigors of adventuring are not always physical,
and players may decide that their experiences have
had a lasting effect on their character’s psyche. It’s
important to consider mental stress effects in conjunc-
tion with safety rules (see Chapter 1: Gamemastery
Troubleshooting, in Trials & Treasures) and their
potential impact on the game. When a group or
the Narrator decides that gamifying mental stress
and morale isn’t right for the campaign, respectful
roleplay is a viable alternative to these mechanics.

| Level | Effects                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Disadvantage on Int, Wis, Cha checks                               |
| 2     | Disadvantage on concentration checks                               |
| 3     | Can only take a bonus action or action eachturn (not both)         |
| 4     | Disadvantage on attacks and saves using Int, Wis, Cha              |
| 5     | Suffer from a randomly determined short-term mental stress effect. |
| 6     | Suffer from a random determined long-term mental stress effect.    |
| 7     | Doomed.                                                            |

##### Mental Stress Effects
The Narrator may decide that a particular encounter that goes badly can leave a lasting impact on adven- turers. Alternatively, if these options are discussed during character creation a player may decide that an event in their past provides sufficient mental stress to bring about a change in their character. These effects provide options for short- and long- term repercussions. A creature may only have one mental stress effect at a time. A long-term effect overrides a short-term effect, and if two effects are of equal strength, the most recent effect replaces the older effect.

A mental stress effect is usually best chosen based on the encounter that causes it and an adventurer’s personality, but may be randomly determined using the mental stress effect tables

##### Short-Term Mental Stress Effects
These conditions are the immediate effects of mental stress after an event or encounter. They last for 1d6 days, but could remain longer based on discussions between the Narrator and player.

- *Bewildered* A bewildered creature is overwhelmed by trying to process a particular event. Its mind begins to play tricks, altering its perceptions. A bewildered creature has disadvantage on social-based ability checks as it struggles to engage with what’s happening. When a bewildered creature would succeed on an ability check, roll another d20. On a result of 15 or less the creature succeeds, but otherwise it fails the ability check instead. This could be caused by a temporary forgetfulness that leads the creature to forget what it was trying to achieve, or in some cases a brief hallucination that alters the circumstances in such a way that it is unable to succeed.

- *Cowed* A cowed creature cannot shake the idea that they are certain to face defeat, and so flinch and surrender at the first sign of danger. After taking any damage in combat, on its next turn a cowed creature takes the Dash action and uses all of its movement to escape danger (or if it is unable to move towards safety, the Dodge action). A cowed creature has disadvantage on Intimidation checks and when given any alternative to combat will happily take it, and it has advantage on Persuasion checks made to try and avoid combat.

- *Distraught* A distraught creature is visibly and deeply shaken by a recent experience, and its apparent distress moves people to do what they can to help. Once per long rest, a distraught creature can choose to gain advantage on a check made to persuade neutral or friendly creatures to aid it, but it has disadvantage on Deception, Performance, and initiative checks.

- *Enraged* An enraged creature is unable to shake its frustration with an enemy or its own perceived failings after an encounter. An enraged creature has advantage on Strength checks, but has disadvantage on all other ability checks. Whenever an enraged creature fails an ability check, it throws or attempts to break any tools or objects involved in the check.

- *Flippant* A flippant creature refuses to face the enormity of whatever event befell it. Not only does a flippant creature superficially shrug off the experience, it goes to reckless ends to prove it is ‘unaffected’ with little regard for itself or allies. A flippant creature has advantage on Dexterity checks, but has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and saving throws.

- *Musical* A musical creature has temporarily taken leave of social norms after a deep shock or strange encounter. Instead of talking, it now sporadically sings its thoughts and during conversation, giving it disad- vantage on Deception, Intimidation, and Stealth checks but advantage on Performance checks.

- *Obsessed* An obsessed creature cannot stop talking about the ordeal that troubles it. It has disadvantage on Stealth checks as it constantly tells allies that it is reminded of “that time when…” Whenever initiative is rolled, an obsessed creature makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or loses 1 round of actions as it wrestles with and exclaims about the similarities to the traumatic encounter in its past.

- *On Edge* A creature that is on edge is hyperaware of its surroundings and unable to fully relax. An on edge creature has advantage on Perception and initiative checks, but disadvantage on all other ability checks as it is distracted, unable to take its mind off the dangers that could potentially lurk around every corner.

- *Sleepless* A sleepless creature is unsettled by its encounter and struggles to relax in order to sufficiently rest. Whenever a sleepless creature takes a long rest, it makes a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to quiet its mind or only gains the benefits of a short rest. During rests where a sleepless creature has failed its Wisdom save, it has advantage on Perception checks made to detect danger.

- *Terrorized* A terrorized creature is not just fearful of danger but convinced it is already here. A terrorized creature is unable to shake its fear response from its unsettling encounter, unwilling to go within 30 feet of strangers or participate in melee combat without succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw first (instead taking the Dash action to escape to safety or retreat from a sudden noise). A terrorized creature has advantage on Perception checks and any Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution checks made to escape combat or danger, but it will sleep only in places with reason- able security precautions.

##### Long-Term Mental Stress Effects
These effects denote a more permanent impact made by the mental stress of traumatic encounters.

- *Covetous* A covetous creature is gripped by a fear of losing in any sense and it begins to desire what is owned by others, no matter how small or seemingly insignifi- cant, feeling deprived by that which they do not have. A covetous creature has advantage on Sleight of Hand checks, but disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws and Deception checks related to things it has taken.

- *Distorted Perceptions* A creature with distorted perceptions has been shaken to its core, and perhaps had its mind jolted by interdimensional travel. Whenever a creature with distorted perceptions rolls a Perception check with a result equal to or less than its passive Percep- tion, small details of the world begin to warp —a swaying tree becomes a dancing shadowy figure, a coil of rope becomes a deadly snake coiled to attack, and its allies may temporarily wear the face of an enemy. These distorted perceptions are brief but absolutely real to the creature. Discussion between the Narrator and the player of an adventurer with distorted perceptions can deter- mine what kind of hallucinations they’re most likely to have and how far they’d like to take it.

- *Hopeless* A hopeless creature has completely lost faith in its purpose and finds it difficult to be motivated. A hopeless creature has advantage on Persuasion checks that involve convincing someone not to take a certain course of action, arguing the pointlessness of it all, but it has disadvantage on initiative checks.

- *Inimical* When an inimical creature is bloodied, on its next turn it takes the Attack action against the nearest creature to it. The inimical creature has disadvan- tage on these attacks as it flails without control. In addition, an inimical creature has disadvantage on checks and saving throws made against being grappled or restrained.

- *Memory Wipe* A creature with a memory wipe becomes forgetful in the extreme after its encounter, perhaps not remem- bering the event at all. A memory wiped creature has disadvantage on Arcana, Culture, History, Nature, and Religion checks, and any other knowledge-based check as its capacity to easily recall information is profoundly affected.

- *Murderous* A murderous creature no longer sees shades of gray when it comes to even the gentlest disagreement or conflict. At the first sign of conflict, whether that be disagreement within the party or a suspicious looking stranger, a murderous creature sees red, attacking first and asking questions later. Dazed by their recklessness, a murderous creature has disadvantage on initiative checks, but advantage on its first attack roll on each of its turns while in such a state. This state lasts for a maximum of 5 rounds, but can be ended earlier by a calm emotions spell or DC 18 Persuasion check.

- *Peacekeeping* A peacekeeping creature wants no more violence and on each of its turns uses all of its actions to prevent or subdue combat by every nonviolent method at its disposal, continuing this course of action until it or an ally are bloodied. A peacekeeping creature has disadvantage on initiative checks but advantage on its first ability check made to try and end a combat.

- *Phobia* A traumatic encounter leads a creature to have a long-term, debilitating fear of some element of the encounter. For example, narrowly escaping a burning building may leave a creature with a phobia of fire. When encountering the subject of its phobia, a creature makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a success the creature can act normally, but on a failure it is frightened for 1 minute (at the Narra- tor’s discretion, depending on the situation it may be incapacitated instead). At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the saving throw, able to act normally on a success.

- *Superstitious* A creature comes to believe it has survived its traumatic encounter thanks only to the presence of a lucky charm. This charm can be anything it had on its person at the time of the event. The super- stitious creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws whenever it is more than 30 feet away from its charm, except for Investigation or Perception checks to find the charm again (which are made with advantage).

- *Suspicious* A suspicious creature has lost faith in the good- ness of the people and circumstances around it. A suspicious creature has advantage on Sleight of Hand checks, and Perception checks to detect hidden foes, but it has disadvantage on Insight checks as it is unable to objectively interpret intentions.

#### Indefinite Mental Stress
It may be that a creature encounters a situation
that inflicts indefinite effects on its psyche. In this
case it may have one or more of any of the above
mental stress effects, with no time limits imposed.
The Narrator should decide which effects and how
many. A creature can only suffer from multiple
mental stress effects if one or more are indefinite
mental stress effects.

##### Saving Throws
Saving throws can be used to determine how a creature handles the mental stress of a particular encounter. When a creature fails a saving throw by 10 or more or rolls a critical failure on a saving throw, it may acquire a short-term mental stress effect determined by what the save was made for. In a tougher encounter, at the Narrator’s discre- tion a success may mean that a creature is left with a short-term mental stress effect, and on a failure it instead acquires a long-term mental stress effect. Wisdom or Charisma saving throws are most likely to relate to a creature’s mental fortitude, however Intelligence or Constitution may be more applicable based on the encounter.

##### Relieving Mental Stress Effects
Like physical injuries, the mental impacts of adven- turing are not permanent. In a world where even death is not necessarily the end, there are also options to recover from the mental impacts of overwhelming events.

##### Roleplay
In the same way that danger sometimes passes without combat, conditions that impact an adven- turer’s psyche (rather than their physical self) can be resolved through effective roleplay. Roleplaying an important resolution for a PC (or even an important NPC) may bring an end to their condi- tion—this might be reuniting with a significant person from their past, finally defeating a sworn enemy, or simply being soothed by the companion- ship and protection of their allies.

##### Personality Changes
A failed saving throw may not lead to a mental stress effect. In some cases after discussion with the group, the Narrator may decide that a particular event leads to a far more fundamental change. The nature of this change and the status of an adventurer’s mental stress effect afterward (it may become a long-term mental stress effect, indefinite, change to a short-term mental stress effect, or be removed entirely) are at the Narrator’s discretion.
