### Changling
Changelings generally look like “unfinished” humans. They have large eyes, but the rest of their features—their thin-lipped mouths, stubby ears, and snub noses—are small. Their skin and lank hair are gray and often have a metallic or waxy sheen. Their eyes are usually gray or dull blue or purple. They lack fingerprints, don’t wrinkle as they age, and have only the barest of creases in their skin at their joint. They are rarely seen in this form, though, for they have the ability to change their shape.

Changelings, sometimes called the unshaped, are a secretive people. This is due in large part because most other heritages strongly distrust them, seeing them as wolves in sheep’s clothing, natural liars and thieves, or as inhuman creatures that snatch babies and leave changelings in their place. Many changelings fit this stereotype. Some see no reason not to treat others the way they themselves are treated, and yet others simply view life as being easier or more fun when they do whatever they want. The majority of changelings are simply people who are trying to get by, though. As a result, few changelings are willing to reveal their True Face or their “Self-Name” (as they call the name given to them by their parents or that they have chosen for themselves) to outsiders.

Each changeling has a False Face, a humanoid form they wear when among other heritages. Creating this Face is a natural instinct, gained sometime before the age of two, and its appearance is heavily influenced by the types of humanoids the individual is exposed to the most.

Changelings are usually taught to treat the Face as different from their true selves, and they create their Face’s identity and personality the way a writer or actor creates a fictional character. Some allow their own personality to drive that of their Face, while others keep themselves strictly separated from their Face.

There are known differences in the Kitsune and Changeling peoples, but they do know each other and are not fond of one another. Not outright hostility, but each disapproves of the other. Changelings disapprove of the Kitsune for revealing themselves to the galaxy and the Kitsune disapprove of the Changeling's tendency to be involved in espionage.

*Species Traits*

Characters with changeling heritage share the
following traits.

- **Age**. Changelings typically mature a bit faster than humans, reaching young adulthood by the age of 13. They typically live as long as humans, or a bit longer, often dying of old age when they reach 110 years old.

- **Size**. Changelings have the same range of heights and weights as humans. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

- **False Face**. Choose a Medium heritage other than this one. You appear as a member of that heritage. The False Face will appear to be roughly the same age you are, can be as much as one foot taller or shorter than you, and may be of any sex you choose. You may use an action to assume this form or return to your true form. You automatically revert to your true form if you die. Each time you go up in level, you may choose to make small changes to your False Face, such as adding or removing a minor feature like a mole or a tattoo, altering your eye color, making yourself appear slightly younger or older, or changing your hair from straight to curly. More radical changes, such as changing your False Face’s apparent heritage, sex, or radically altering your facial features to the point you appear as a different person, require the Narrator’s approval.

- **Mimicry**. You can mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful Insight check opposed by your choice of Deception or Performance.

- **Shaping Astra**. When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast alter self once, and then can’t cast it again until you complete a long rest. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice) is your spellcasting ability for this trait.

*Species Gifts*

- **DOUBLE** Doubles are changelings who can alter their appearance and even their biology to appear as a person of any heritage. They must have previously seen the type of heritage they wish to copy, and they can attempt to copy individuals they have seen as well as create their own appearance. Most doubles have multiple preferred identities of all manner of heritages, ages, and sexes. Others simply change their face to fit their mood and rely on their False Face, or even their True Face, as their sole identity. You gain the following traits:

- *Infiltrators*. Living life in the shadows of others has caused changelings to develop a natural talent at understanding and manipulating others. You are proficient in your choice of Deception, Insight, or Persuasion.

- *Shapechanging*. As an action, you can change your appearance and voice to that of any Medium humanoid, including duplicating a specific humanoid you have seen and heard. You can change your hair, eye, and skin color, your hair style and length, and your apparent or biological sex. You must retain your own number of limbs. Your game statistics don’t change, and you can’t change the appearance of your clothing or equipment. You revert to your true form if you die. If you are incapacitated or fall unconscious, you instead revert to your False Face form. If you mimic a specific individual, you gain an expertise die on Deception checks made to pass as that individual.
- *Double Astra*. When you reach 5th level, you gain the ability to cast detect thoughts once, and then can’t cast it again until you complete a long rest. Your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this trait.

**Paragon Gift** When you reach 10th level, you become a paragon of changelings. You gain both of the following traits:

- *Improved Astra*. You can cast alter self twice between long rests.
- *Malleable Flesh*. Your ability to change your shape means that you can close your wounds. You may use an action to regain a number of hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.

### Drakneri
*Background and Details*: The Drakneri are an advanced race of bipedal beings, embodying the majesty and strength of dragons. With origins lost to time, they have developed a sophisticated society marked by technological innovation.

*History*: The Drakneri once had an empire that spanned hundreds of thousands of light years, tens of thousands of stars. They were allied with two other races called the Celestar and the Krios and they made The Cosmic Alliance. The Alliance was attacked by the Synthar ten thousand years ago with a nanite based virus. The Celestar were not from this galaxy originally and were wiped out no one knows if any of their technology survived. The Krios fled and have not been seen since. The Drakneri loaded themselves onto a set of Clutch Ships and ventured deep into 'Verse into Wild Space. When they returned their civilization was much the same as it was, albeit smaller only about twenty thousand Drakneri are alive. They are the most technologically advanced race in the known galaxy and they horde their technology they are incredibly unwilling to share it.

They have established a base on Illusia and it is protected by a near impenetrable force field, in orbit they have a fleet of dozens of their Drake Class battleships.

*Languages*: Drakneri communicate using their native language, Draknish, which combines hisses, growls, and precise vocal intonations. Many Drakneri also learn Galactic Common to facilitate communication with other species.

- Tech Level rules. As a TL 5 species they have resistance to damage from lower tech species on their ships. This affects their shields and not their hull. Though their hulls are immune to Fire, Cold, Necrotic, and Radiant damage as well as being resistant to Energy damage. They do take regular damage on the hull from Kinetic weapons. Their shields are resistant to all damage. This does **not** apply if the other species is using TL 5 weapons. The Drakneri weapons are also more devastating. If they are 1 TL down Drakneri weapons ignore resistances, making Immune -> Resistant, and Resistant -> Normal, if they are 2 or more levels below then their weapons strike as if the target were Vulnerable to the damage, if for some reason they are 4 or more levels above the other side then they do Max Damage (doubled for Vulnerable) and would take no damage from their weapons.

### Centaur
The term "Centaurus" evokes a myriad of images in our futuristic cosmos. They are not merely one-dimensional beings but a multifaceted race, adapting to various roles and lifestyles among the stars.

Some Centaurus are noble cosmic knights, embodying the unwavering loyalty of an interstellar steed fused with the valor of a daring starfarer. Others pursue the path of cosmic healing, scientific inquiry, cosmic wisdom, and celestial navigation, becoming revered scholars and celestial astronomers. However, not all Centaurus walk this enlightened path; some embrace their primal instincts, transforming into ferocious cosmic barbarians, bearing more resemblance to cosmic beasts than sentient beings. And there are those who revel in the mysterious realms of the cosmos, joining fey-like gatherings among the stars, where they share cosmic libations with enigmatic satyrs, far from the conventional "civilized" worlds.

In reality, there's no singular definition for Centaurus, as they are an incredibly diverse and adaptable race. A Centaurus boasts the body of a compact cosmic steed, but from its celestial withers emerges a humanoid head and torso, resembling that of a human. Their ears are subtly pointed, far more agile than a human's, and their countenances often exhibit equine-like features. Cosmic strands of hair, mirroring the hue of their tails, cascade down their backs in the form of short, cosmic manes. Their robust lower bodies grant them tireless cosmic agility, and most Centaurus find solace in cosmic races, where they can feel the cosmic winds caressing their manes and tails, their hooves rhythmically connecting with the stellar terrain beneath. Sedentary existence rarely appeals to these celestial beings; they are creatures of motion and cosmic exploration.

**Centaur Traits**

Characters with the centaur heritage share a variety of traits in common with one another.

- *Age*. Centaurs mature slightly earlier than humans do, reaching maturity in their mid-teens. While they age at about the same rate as humans and have similar lifespans, they reach old age earlier, usually in their sixties or seventies. Their minds tend to remain sharp while their body suffers the pangs of age earlier than with humans.

- *Size*. Most centaurs stand between 4 to 4 1/2 feet tall (1.2 to 1.4 meters) at the withers, and as tall as 6 1/2 to 7 feet tall (2 to 2.1 meters) at the tops of their heads. They usually weigh between 700 and 900 pounds (317 to 408 kg). Some are smaller, but rarely by much. Your size is Medium. However, some centaurs have the Large Size gift, detailed below.

- *Speed*. Your walking speed is 40 feet. Monstrous Ancestry. You have the Monstrosity creature type in addition to the Humanoid type.

- *Ungulate Build*. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag (but not how much you can lift). You can also carry an additional two Bulky items. While you can carry other creatures on your back, up to what your Strength score allows you to carry, you can’t ride on other creatures unless they are outfitted with a howdah or similar object, and you can only ride on vehicles that are at least one size larger than you.

- *Hooves*. Your hooves are natural melee weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with your hooves, you deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage for an unarmed strike.

- **Centaur Gifts**
There are so numerous myths about centaurs, and each of them has a grain of truth to them, as shown by the innate abilities many centaurs have. In addition to the traits found in your centaur heritage, select one of the following centaur gifts.

- **UNENDING STRENGTH**
Centaurs have incredible stamina and are able to work tirelessly long past the time that other people are desperate for rest. Some centaurs are even tougher than others. Centaurs with this gift have the following features:

- *Tireless*. You have advantage on saving throws made to resist taking fatigue or strife. Additionally, engaging in strenuous activity doesn’t interrupt your long rest.

- *Workhorse*. You gain an expertise die in Athletics checks you make. If you fail a Strength ability check or saving throw, you may reroll it and choose which result you want to use. Once you have done so, you can’t do so again until you complete a short or long rest.

- **STAR-ARCHER**
A popular centaur legend says that the first of their kind—who taught centaurs the art of archery—was immortalized in the heavens as a constellation. Many centaurs therefore have a strong belief in astrology and allow the stars to guide them. Centaurs with this gift have the following features: 

- *Child of the Star-Archer*. The stars have blessed you with certain skills. You are proficient in long bows and short bows, and in navigator’s tools. You also gain a specialization in Engineering(Astrogation)

- *Star-Sight*. You gain darkvision to 60 feet. you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

- **Paragon Gifts**
When you reach 10th level, you are an exemplar of centaur-kind, and you gain one paragon gift from the following list: 

- *Brute*. Your hooves are like battering rams, your muscles are like iron, and your hide is like steel. Your hooves inflict 2d4 damage instead of 1d4, and your hooves count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Additionally, your armor class increases by 1.

- *Racehorse*. When you take the Dash action, you may move an additional 10 feet. When you take the Sprint action, you may move an additional 20 feet. Additionally, when you take one of these actions, you don’t provoke opportunity attacks.
