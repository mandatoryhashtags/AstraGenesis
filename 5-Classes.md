### Commanding Presence

Starting at 1st level, you have a Commanding Presence which extends from you in a 10-foot radius. 

Your allies can attack at your command. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo making one attack to allow a friendly creature within range of your Commanding Presence to make an attack instead. If the target can hear or see you, it can use its reaction to either cast a cantrip or make one weapon attack.

The range of your presence increases to 20 feet at 5th level, 30 feet at 10th level, 45 feet at 15th level, and 60 feet at 20th level.

### Rallying Surge

Also at 1st level, you can use a bonus action to choose an ally within 30 feet of you. If the target can hear or see you, it regains hit points equal to 1d8 + your envoy level. Once you use this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can use it again.

You can simultaneously target 2 allies with this feature at 3rd level, and starting at 7th level you regain use of this feature after finishing a short or long rest.

### Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Biting Zephyr, Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current, Razor’s Edge, Sanguine Knot, Spirited Steed, Unending Wheel. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.


You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest . You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known 
column of the Envoy table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Lessons of War

Also at 2nd level you learn a lesson of war of your choice. Your lessons are detailed at the end of the class description. The Lessons Known column of the Envoy table shows when you learn more lessons of war.

### Archetype

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that focuses on the military stratagems you devise. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### Mark Foe

Also at 3rd level, your martial direction improves the efficiency of your allies’ attacks against an enemy you focus their attention on. You can use a bonus action to choose a creature you can see within 30 feet. Until the start of your next turn, creatures able to hear or see you gain an expertise die on attacks made against that creature.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Combat Directives

Starting at 5th level, you can direct your companions so effectively that they can use the techniques you’ve mastered. You learn one additional combat maneuver from the Sanguine Knot tradition. This combat maneuver does not count against the number of combat maneuvers that you know.

In addition, when a creature uses your Commanding Presence to make an attack, it can simultaneously use one Sanguine Knot combat maneuver that you know. If the creature does not have any exertion points to spend on combat maneuvers, it does not require exertion points for that use but it cannot benefit from Combat Directives again until it has finished a short or long rest .

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. The number of attacks increases to three when you reach 11th level.

### Followers

At 5th level, you gain one inexperienced follower . At 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you gain an additional follower or one of your followers becomes more experienced.

When one of your followers dies, after 1 month you receive word that their replacement is ready to join you.

### Call to Arms

### Martial Renown

At 6th level, tales of your deeds take root in the hearts of the people. As a leader, you are more famous than most adventurers. You add half your proficiency bonus to your Prestige rating.

In addition, your reputation strongly affects how you are perceived, and when it becomes known that you are in a settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport people treat you accordingly. At the GM's discretion, there may be settlements (such as an enemy’s war camp) where you cannot utilize this feature. Choose one of the following:

- **Famous**

When you arrive in a settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport, after you reveal who you are local authority figures seek you out to make introductions and invite you to share a meal or drink. 

In addition, you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. 

- **Infamous**

When you arrive in a settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport, after you reveal who you are common folk hurry to get out of your way, and when you corner a commoner to ask about something local they rapidly tell you whatever details they think you might want to know. 

In addition, you gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks.

- **Maverick**

When you arrive in a settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport, after you reveal who you are the local watch starts keeping an eye on you. Heads of illegal organizations may introduce themselves to you if they have goals well suited to your talents. Additionally, guards expect you’re up to no good so are quick to leave their posts to follow you.

### Versatile Exploration

Also at 6th level, whenever you learn a new lesson of war or replace an existing one, you can instead choose from mercenary soldiering knacks.

### Archetype Feature

At 7th level you gain another archetype feature.

### Spur Ally

Starting at 13th level, you regain use of this feature after finishing a short or long rest.

### Expanded Directives

Starting at 10th level, your capacity to direct your companions broadens. Choose one tradition that you know combat maneuvers from. You are able to use Combat Directives to grant uses of combat maneuvers from the chosen tradition.

At 15th level, choose a second tradition that you know combat maneuvers from.

### Rouse the Troops

Also at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute speaking words of encouragement and support to reinvigorate your companions. Each friendly creature that can hear or understand you can spend any number of Hit Dice to regain hit points without having to finish a short rest . In addition, each creature that does spend at least one Hit Die in this way can remove one level of fatigue or strife it is suffering from. Once a creature has removed a level of fatigue or strife from your use of this class feature, the creature must finish a long rest before it can do so again.

### Archetype Feature

At 11th level you gain another archetype feature.

### Commanding Demeanor

Starting at 12th level, the lessons you’ve learned on the battlefield become useful tools beyond the realm of combat. Choose one of the following:

- **Calm**

Knowing how and when to embrace quietude allows your silence to speak far louder than any words, and you easily pick up on the subtleties revealed by body language and demeanor. When you first meet an NPC, you can choose to remain silent and speak through nonvisual cues—scrunching your brows, pursing your lips, narrowing your eyes, slowly leaning ever so slightly forward, hunching your shoulders, and so on. As long as you remain silent for 1 minute, the NPC has a CR lower than your level, and it remains within sight of you for the duration, it acts as if you succeeded on an Intimidation check. 

In addition, you gain an expertise die on Insight checks.

- **Resolute**

Winning a battle is as much about knowing when to quit as it is knowing when not to give up. Whenever you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check against a creature and fail, you gain an expertise die on your next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check made against that creature.

- **Responsive**

Whether between duelists or armies, combat is all about timing and you are impeccably punctual. When you overhear an interesting conversation between NPCs, you can interject so seamlessly and casually that the speakers think they already know you, answering one question you ask before realizing that they don’t. 

In addition, you gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks.

### Dauntless

Beginning at 13th level, you and allies within your Commanding Presence have advantage on saving&nbsp;throws against spells and effects that cause the charmed or frightened conditions.

14th LevelAdvantageous Action

Starting at 14th level, your experience in battle lets you help your companions more easily. You can use the Help action as a bonus action. In addition, when you take the Help action choose one of the following effects:

  - You end the frightened condition on one creature within 30 feet of you that can hear or see you.
  - You grant one creature within 5 feet of you temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier.

At 16th level, your stronghold is upgraded to grade 5.

### Critical Weakness

Beginning at 17th level, you can focus your mind to identify any enemy’s weaknesses. As a bonus action, you can choose a creature you can see within 60 feet, exposing a flaw in its defenses. Until the end of your next turn, any creature able to hear or see you has advantage on attack rolls made against that creature, and their attacks and spells deal an extra 6 damage to it. Once you have used this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest .

### Archetype Feature

At 18th level you gain another archetype feature.

### Impressive Reputation

Starting at 18th level, your very name can inspire courage in the hearts of soldiers, fear among the ranks of the enemy, or uncertainty in the minds of the commanders set against you. Choose one of the following:

- **Hero**

Inspiring tales of your victories have won you friends in high places. Nobles and royalty treat you as an equal, granting you free lodging, food, and a place upon their court for a number of days up to your envoy level.

- **Iconoclast**

You are known for doing the unexpected and people love to hear about it. Whenever you arrive in a settlement/colony/starport you are visited by 1d4+1 bards, scholars, and sages asking for recountings of your recent exploits. In exchange they each either share a piece of information they think might be relevant to your current quest, or make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma check (bonus of +5) on your behalf to answer a specific question.

- **Slaughterer**

Tales of your merciless bloodshed have won you friends in unlikely places. Bandit and pirate captains, crimelords, intelligent monsters of ill intent, and even fiends know who you are and that you are a valuable ally, doing their best to persuade you to take up the sword against their enemies. Whenever you encounter such a creature, it spends its first action (even in combat) declaring that it knows of your prowess and offering an alliance. 

### Legendary Commander

At 20th level, friendly creatures within range of your Commanding Presence add your Charisma modifier (minimum 1) to their saving throws . Additionally, choose one of the following:

- **Commander’s Expertise**

Whenever a creature uses your Commanding Presence to make an attack or use a combat maneuver, it gains an expertise die . If the combat maneuver has a save DC, it increases by an amount equal to the result of the expertise die. This expertise die can be increased to a maximum of a d12.

- **Feedback Loop**

Whenever a creature uses your Commanding Presence and successfully hits their target, you gain a reaction. You must use this reaction before the start of your next turn or it is lost.

- **Rapid Deployment**

After initiative is rolled and until combat ends, your Speed increases by 20 feet, and allies that are able to see or hear you increase their Speed by 20 feet.

### Supreme Stronghold

Also at 20th level, your stronghold is upgraded to grade 6.

### Lessons of War
When you gain access to a new lesson of war, choose one of the following.

- **EXACTING**
You’ve won more battles armed with a sextant and your keen intellect than you have any blade. You gain proficiency with navigator’s tools, or if you are already proficient, an expertise die on checks made using them. When determining the distance you travel while journeying, you can make a DC 10 navigator’s tools check to travel an additional number of miles equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **KEEP WALKING**
You can motivate your allies to keep going even when they are tired and hungry. Once between long rests , you can choose a number of allies equal to twice your proficiency bonus who can hear or understand you. Each ally can travel an additional hour before needing to make a Constitution saving throw for a forced march.

- **LAY OF THE LAND**
Knowledge of the terrain can be the difference between victory and defeat. By spending 10 minutes observing the area in a 2-mile radius you can spend 2 exertion points to pick out where there are choke points, large swathes of cover, watercourses, vegetations that can offer concealment , ridgelines, and so on. You gain an expertise die on Engineering and Survival checks made within the area, and on checks made to prepare an ambush or realize you are being ambushed.

- **REWARDING REPUTE**
Your deeds have heroically won over the hearts and minds of people everywhere or cowed them into submission. Whenever you visit a settlement/colony/starport, the commoners there tell you all the valuable information they can about their home including nearby ruins, the general environment of nearby wilderness, and how populated the region is. You gain an expertise die on Nature and Survival checks made within 10 miles of any settlement/colony/starport you have visited.

- **SOLDIER KITTING**
The weapons of war are rarely small, light, or easy to carry but you’ve learned tricks to lessen the burden. You and a number of creatures equal to your proficiency bonus are able to carry one additional bulky item .

- **TEAM TACTICS**
With your directions to help there is very little your companions can’t accomplish. When more than one creature takes the Help action to aid an ally making an ability check, for each additional creature helping the check is made with a +1 bonus. Only a number of additional creatures equal to half your proficiency bonus are able to Help in this way.

- **TEAMWORK**
When you are involved in a group check, all members of the check gain an expertise die . Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest

### Archtypes

  - **ON GUARD**: When you use your Rallying Surge to allow a creature to regain hit points, that creature also gains an expertise die on one saving throw it makes in the next minute.

-  **EXPLORER'S CODE**
Also at 7th level, you learn to communicate with your allies using coded language, allowing you to hide additional messages in normal conversation. During the light activity portion of a long rest , you can teach this code to any friendly creature with which you share a language. It takes twice as long to convey a message this way.

#### GAMBLING GENERAL
Go big or go home. That saying may seem incredibly risky under circumstances that could determine the fates of entire nations, yet gambler envoys thrive on balancing risk and reward to make the impossible possible. At times, the luck these envoys have bordered on being miraculous, though many say their success is a matter of skill, not talent.

 - **DARING COMMANDER**
At 3rd level when you select this archetype, choose one of the following.

  - **DARING ASSAULT**: While you are conscious, any ally within range of your Commanding Presence that makes an attack roll can choose to roll with a –5 penalty. If the attack hits, the attack deals an extra 2d6 damage. At 15th level, the amount of extra damage increases to 3d6.
  - **DARING CHARGE**: While you are conscious, any ally that starts its turn within range of your Commanding Presence can use an action to move up to twice its Speed in a straight line and take the Attack action.

- **DEFENSIVE MEASURES**
At 7th level, choose one of the following.

  - **DESPERATE AVOIDANCE**: When you make a saving throw you can choose to make the saving throw with advantage , but you make all attack rolls with disadvantage until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short rest or long rest .
  - **FRANTIC AVOIDANCE**: When you would make a saving throw against an area effect, you can use your reaction to move up to half your Speed. If you end your movement outside the area, it has no effect on you. Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest .

- **HOLD THE LINE**
At 11th level, choose one of the following.

- **STAND FIRM**
While you are conscious, any ally within range of your Commanding Presence feature that would make a saving throw can choose to make the saving throw with disadvantage . If a success on the saving throw would cause the ally to take half the damage, the ally takes no damage on a successful save instead.

- **STAND STRONG**
While you are conscious, you can direct allies to make retaliatory attacks. When an ally within range of your Commanding Presence is hit by a melee weapon attack , they can use their reaction to make a melee weapon attack against their attacker.

- **RISKY TACTICS**
At 15th level, choose one of the following.

  - **RISKY GAMBIT**: You can use a bonus action to choose one creature within range of your Commanding Presence. The target immediately provokes an opportunity attack from one creature that can reach it. If the creature makes the attack, that creature grants advantage on all attack rolls made against it until the start of your next turn.
  - **RISKY FORAY**: At the start of an ally’s turn, if it is within range of your Commanding Presence you can use your reaction to spur them into violent action. Until the start of its next turn, your ally gains an expertise die on melee weapon attack rolls, and creatures gain an expertise die on melee weapon attack rolls against it.

At 18th level, choose one of the following. 

  - **FEINTING RETREAT**: When you take the Disengage action, until the start of your next turn, when a creature ends its movement within range of your Commanding Presence it provokes an opportunity attack .
  - **LAY THE TRAP**: While you are conscious, whenever a creature makes an attack roll against you and misses, you and one creature of your choice make your next attack roll against the triggering creature with advantage before the end of your next turn.

#### TALENTED TACTICIAN
The most brilliant of tactician envoys are those who can sit far away from the frontlines and yet picture every move their enemy might take. For each move, they plan an appropriate response to drive their foe into desperation and surrender without ever firing a shot or lifting a sword.

- **TACTICAL EDGE**
Beginning at 3rd level when you choose this archetype, whenever you roll initiative, you gain a tactics die, which is a d4. While you have this die, any creature friendly to you within 60 feet of you that can hear or see you can roll the tactics die as a bonus die when making an attack roll . Once rolled, the tactics die is lost until you regain it at the start of your next turn. The tactics die disappears when the combat ends.

If you start your turn and no one has rolled the tactics die, you can trade out the die for a die of the next larger size, such that a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, and so on up to a maximum of d12. After the tactics die is rolled, when regained it reverts to a d4.

- **STUDENT OF WAR**
At 7th level, choose either Culture, History, or Nature. You gain proficiency with the chosen skill and an expertise die on checks made using the chosen skill. 

- **OPERATIONS LEADER**
Starting at 11th level, you devise a set of communication cues. Any allies who have received this training—usually taking 10 minutes of discussion and practice—do not need to share a language with you to benefit from this feature.

Additionally on your turn, you can use a bonus action and spend 5 exertion points to make it easier for you and your allies to help each other with certain skills. While this coordination is in place, your chosen allies can take the Help action as a bonus action to help each other. This coordination requires you to maintain concentration, and both chosen allies—the one with the skill proficiency and the one making the ability check—to be within 30 feet of you at the time of the ability check. 

You can use your bonus action to change which allies benefit from the coordination each turn and you are able to concentrate on it for up to 10 minutes. The skills that can benefit from this are Acrobatics, Animal Handling, Athletics, Deception, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Stealth, and Survival. This might be used to help the team navigate difficult terrain , maintain a façade while undercover, or perform an ambush.

If you have proficiency in Stealth this coordination can happen silently via surreptitious signals. If you have proficiency in Deception this coordination can happen as a series of code words interspersed with other conversation. An onlooker needs to succeed on an Insight check contested by your ability check—whether Stealth or Deception—to realize the coordination is taking place.

- **SUPERIOR TACTICS**
At 15th level, choose one of the following.
  - **MORE TACTICAL**: Whenever you gain a tactics die, you gain an additional tactics die to a maximum of two dice. The second tactics die can be used like the first and the tactics die increases size in the manner described under the Tactical Edge class feature.
  - **TACTICAL EFFICACY**: Your tactics die begins at d6. When you reach 20th level, your tactics die begins at d8.

- **HIDDEN RESOURCES**
At 18th level, choose one of the following.

  - **DIG DEEPER**: You can take a bonus action to allow a creature to regain the use of an origin trait or class feature that would normally be regained by finishing a short rest . You can use this feature twice and you regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest .
  - **REACH FURTHER**: While you are conscious and when an ally within range of your Commanding Presence would drop to 0 or fewer hit points, your ally can use their reaction to spend the tactics die and roll it to gain temporary hit points equal to the result plus your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). Once a creature has benefited from the tactics die in this way, it cannot do so again until it finishes a long rest .

### EXPLORATION KNACKS
For a explorer exploration isn't just something that happens between destinations—it’s a way of life. You start with two explorer exploration knacks of your choice. Your exploration knacks are detailed at the end of the class description. The Knacks Known column of the Explorer table shows when you learn more exploration knacks.

### FAMILIAR TERRAIN
At 1st level, you are particularly adept at traveling and surviving in natural environments. When making an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to any natural terrain, you gain an expertise die if using a skill you're proficient in. While traveling in any natural terrain, you gain the following benefits:

Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. 

Your group can’t become lost except by ~empowered~ means. Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling you remain alert to danger. Your passive Perception increases by 2. 

If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. 

When you Hunt and Gather, you find twice as much Supply as you normally would. While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.

### STUDIED ADVERSARY
You have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even communicating with your enemies. Choose a type of adversary: aberrations, beasts, constructs, elementals, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can select two humanoid heritages (such as Humans and Berexar, Synths and Androids count as Constructs) as studied adversaries.

You have advantage on Survival checks to track your studied adversaries, as well as on ability checks to recall information about them. You also learn to communicate with basic words in a language of your choice that is spoken by your studied adversaries, if they speak one at all.

During a long rest, you can replace a current studied adversary with a new one.

### COMBAT MANEUVERS
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Biting Zephyr, Mirror’s Glint, Rapid Current, Razor’s Edge, Spirited Steed, and Unending Wheel. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known 
column of the Explorer table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### STRIDE AND SEEK
Your wilderness survival instincts guide your physical and mental training. You gain one of the following features at 2nd level. You gain the other feature when you reach 5th level in this class.

#### HUNTER’S TARGET
You can use your bonus action to focus your attention on a specific enemy. Choose a creature you can see within 90 feet to mark as your quarry. For 1 hour, you are focused on this creature. You gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls against the creature, and your weapon attacks against it deal an extra 1d6 damage. In addition, you have advantage on Perception and Survival checks you make to find it. If the creature drops to 0 hit points before the hour ends, you can use a bonus action to mark a new quarry. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest .

#### SWIFT FEET
You can use your bonus action to move with greater agility. For 1 minute, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. You can choose to end this effect early to either increase your Speed by 30 feet until the end of your turn or gain advantage on a weapon attack. 

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest .

### TRAINED ACCURACY
At 2nd level, you learn to maintain a level of discipline that spills over into everything you do. This perpetual state of focus allows you to perform incredible feats. When using Trained Accuracy, the bonus to attack rolls from Fighting Style: Archery becomes a +2 bonus to damage on ranged weapon attacks.

Note: An adventurer that has Fighting Style: Archery gains no bonus to attack rolls from the fighting style when using Trained Accuracy, and instead gains a +2 bonus to damage on ranged weapon attacks.

#### ACCURACY BONUS
When you make a weapon attack, you can use your reaction to gain an attack bonus or damage bonus as shown on the Accuracy Bonus table. Between long rests, you have a number of uses equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1).

Table: Accuracy Bonus

| Bonus                 | Cost   |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| +1 hit or +1d6        | 1 use  |
| +2 hit or +3d6 damage | 2 uses |
| +3 hit or +5d6 damage | 3 uses |
 
#### ACCURACY RESERVE
If you have not moved since the beginning of your last turn, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon attack rolls until the end of your turn. You lose this bonus if you move.

### RANGER ARCHETYPE
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that embodies your purpose as a explorer. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### WILDERNESS MYSTIQUE
At 4th level your experience as an expert survivalist manifests at the subconscious level. Choose one of the following options:

  - **ANSWERING SILENCE**: When others seek your advice on wilderness matters, they often arrive at the correct conclusion despite (or perhaps because of) the silence with which you respond. When a friendly creature makes a Nature or Survival check while within 5 feet of you, it gains an expertise die .
  - **FEARSOME MYSTICISM**: Your uncanny abilities and single-minded focus can be unnerving to the uninitiated. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks against any creature that is neither proficient in Arcana nor ~~casts~~{uses } spells. 
  - **KINDRED SPIRIT**: You intuitively sense when another wilderness expert is nearby. Your passive Perception increases by 5 to detect hidden or invisible creatures within 30 feet of you, and you instantly detect whether any creature you can see is proficient with Stealth or Survival.

### EXTRA ATTACK
At 5th level you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### ADVERSARIAL FOCUS
At 6th level you gain an additional studied adversary, and you gain a +1 bonus on weapon attack rolls made against your studied adversaries.

### GAME HUNTING
At 6th level, you have advantage on any check made to locate or catch local game animals in the wild and gain the following features:

You have proficiency with nets, and being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls with a net.
You can use a 30-foot length of rope or strong vine as a lasso and try to grapple a creature within 20 feet of you. As long as a creature is grappled by your lasso, it is also restrained . The lasso has AC 13 and 7 hit points. It is vulnerable to slashing damage and resistant to bludgeoning damage. If the lasso drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
When you use the Attack action and attack with a dual-wielding weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a net or use a lasso you are holding.

### ARCHETYPE FEATURE
At 7th level you gain another archetype feature.

### EXPLORER’S INSTINCT
At 8th level, once between long rests , you can take two reactions in a round instead of one.

In addition, whenever you learn a new explorer exploration knack or replace an existing one, you can choose from druid secrets of nature or mercenary soldiering knacks.

### FLASH OF STEEL
At 9th level you gain the Missile Volley or Whirlwind Strike combat maneuver. It does not count against your number of maneuvers known and you do not have to spend exertion points to activate it.

### HUNTER’S FOCUS
At 9th level, you can remain focused on your Hunter’s Target for up to 8 hours.

### TRACKLESS HUNTING
At 10th level, you can’t be tracked except by ~empowered~ means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

In addition, whenever you learn a new explorer exploration knack or replace an existing one, you can choose to learn a specialist skill trick instead.

### ARCHETYPE FEATURE
At 11th level you gain another archetype feature.

### WILDERNESS LORE
At 12th level, your knowledge of wilderness lore deepens. Choose one of the following options:

- **BIG GAME TRAPS**: Leveraging your skill with snaring small game, you take 10 minutes to set a trap or snare for a creature of Large size or smaller. 
The trap's DC is 8 + your Dexterity bonus + your proficiency bonus. A creature can spot the trap by making a Perception check against the trap's DC.
Describe the mechanics of your trap to the Narrator, including what triggers it and what happens when triggered. You may use the following examples or work with the Narrator to invent your own. 
When a creature enters the trapped area or interacts with the trapped object it makes a Dexterity saving throw against the trap's DC or triggers the trap.

    - Pendulum Trap. Creatures within 5 feet of the trap are struck by a swinging object that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (determined by the object) equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom bonus. 
    - Pit Trap. The creature falls into a pre-existing pit or hazard that you have concealed.
    - Rope Trap. The creature is either knocked prone or restrained by a net or rope.

- **WASTE NOT**
With 10 minutes work you can scavenge valuable cuts from the corpse of a beast, dragon, monstrosity, or plant that has a CR of 1 or higher and has died within the last hour. If sold to a collector, druid, or other naturalist, this notable component is worth an amount of chits equal to 50 × the creature’s CR.

### GUARDED POST
Experience has taught you that defending others is often the key to survival. At 13th level choose one of the following options:

  - **DEFENSIVE MARKSMAN**: When a hostile creature moves towards you or a companion, you can use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it. 

  - **HUNTER’S BLIND**: You can spend 10 minutes constructing a natural shelter able to accommodate yourself and up to 9 other creatures of Medium size or smaller. The shelter blends in with its surroundings, and as long as no one moves into or out of it, the shelter is indistinguishable from a natural object. It is designed to allow creatures inside to see out but prevent anyone outside from seeing in. 

The shelter is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside, and counts as a haven .

### TACTICAL ADVANTAGE
At 14th level you gain a third studied adversary. In addition, you can choose one of the following explorer tactics: 

  - **COVERED SHOT**: When you are protected by half cover , you gain the benefits of three-quarters cover (+5 to AC, Dexterity saving throws , and ability checks made to hide).
  - **NATURE’S SHADOW**: You gain an expertise die on Stealth checks.

### ARCHETYPE FEATURE

  - **UNDER THE STARS**: You gain the benefits of a long rest in half the normal amount of time.
  - **WOODLORE**: Using your action, you can produce a flame at a moment’s notice even in wet or cold environments. You can hold the flame in your hand without harming yourself or your equipment. Without additional fuel, the flame lasts for 10 minutes, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

### HUNTER’S INTENT
At 17th level, you add your Wisdom bonus to the damage you inflict with a weapon attack.

- **BEASTLY ATTACK**: Once on each of your turns, a beast that is friendly to you and able to see or hear you can use its reaction to make a single attack.

    - Your walking and climbing speed increase by 5 feet.
    - When you are protected by three-quarters cover , you gain the benefits of total cover. 
    - If you make a weapon attack against a creature, your movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from it until the beginning of your next turn.
    - When you move through an area, you can cause it to become difficult terrain until the beginning of your next turn, and any creature that moves through the area during that time has disadvantage on its next attack roll.

### EXTREME EXPLORATION
Your travels and training have taken you to new heights and amazing depths. At 19th level, you gain two of the following benefits:

  - You gain resistance to fire and cold damage.
  - You gain immunity to poison.

### EXPLORATION KNACKS
When you gain access to a new exploration knack, choose one of the following. Some knacks have requirements, such as minimum explorer level or another knack. You must meet those requirements before you choose that knack.

- **BEAST FRIEND**
 
If you spend 10 minutes befriending and feeding a Medium or smaller beast of CR 1/8 or less, you become its guardian explorer. It follows you and is loyal to you, but it acts independently. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. The beast won’t attack except as a reaction to being attacked, but it can take other actions as normal and makes death saving throws. You can only be a guardian explorer to one beast at a time.

- **BUILD SHELTER**

You can spend a day (8 hours) building a basic shelter which protects up to 8 people from the elements and reduces the likelihood of attack from monsters and bandits. The shelter counts as a haven . It lasts for as long as it is needed, but falls apart permanently after being left for a month unattended.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again for a week.

- **CALLS OF THE WILD**

Using verbal and nonverbal cues to communicate with beasts, you can gain basic information from them or make a simple request (like delivering a short message or small object). 

- **EAR TO THE GROUND**

By expending 1 minute remaining stationary, using sound and vibrations alone, until you move or take an action you are able to deduce information up to 30 feet in every direction, as if using blindsight or tremorsense.

- **EXPERT FORAGING**

Once between long rests , you can take 1 minute to collect a number of edible, non-poisonous plants and grubs equal to your proficiency bonus. A creature can use its action to eat up to 5 plants or grubs, each of which restores 1 hit point. The grubs die and spoil 1 hour after being collected.

- **FORCED MARCHER**

You can travel an additional number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus before needing to make a Constitution saving throw for a forced march.

- **GUIDE**

While traveling, when you would have a failure or critical failure for a Scout journey activity, you succeed instead, and you can Scout while engaged in any other journey activity.


- **HEALING SALVES**

Once between long rests you can spend an hour to collect natural ingredients and concoct an ointment that speeds healing. This salve is potent for 24 hours and has a number of uses equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier. As an action, you can use the salve to restore 1d4 hit points to a creature within reach.

- **HERBAL BITTERS**

You can spend an hour to collect ingredients and brew two servings of a bitter drink that is potent for 24 hours. Imbibing a serving takes an action and reduces fatigue by one level for 4 hours.


- **HUNTSMAN**

When you use the Hunt and Gather journey activity, you gain advantage on your Survival checks.


- **LONGWALKER**
When you would gain a level of fatigue due to lack of Supply during a journey, you do not gain that level of fatigue. Alternatively, you can choose to accept the level of fatigue, allowing up to two traveling companions to forgo gaining a level of fatigue instead. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again for a week.


- **MASTER TRACKER**

Prerequisite: 9th level

You can spend 5 minutes looking at a 30-foot diameter outdoor area to study the ground and other clues. You learn all events which transpired in that area in the last 24 hours as though you had witnessed them yourself, although you do not learn secret information not obvious to an observer. The information you gain is only that which would be learned by sight; you do not gain sound-based information or learn what creatures in the area said to each other. 

Once you have used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest .

- **MONSTER MIMIC**

By imitating how a beast or studied adversary sounds, looks, and moves, you gain advantage on Deception and Intimidation checks made to convince a creature that it is seeing or hearing that beast or studied adversary.


- **POISONS AND ANTIDOTES**
Once between long rests you can spend 10 minutes to extract 3 doses of liquid poison (when ingested, a creature makes a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or is poisoned for 1 hour) from poisonous plants you’ve foraged with an hour of searching and DC 10 Survival check. Alternatively, using the same plants you can spend an hour making a dose of antitoxin (see Chapter 4: Equipment).

- **READ THE ROOM**

By spending 10 minutes observing facial expressions, body language, and vocal intonation, you can detect minute details which give you insight into the creatures within 30 feet of you. For the next minute, you can direct your focus on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet. If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can shift your attention to another creature’s thoughts.

- **RELENTLESS PURSUIT**

Once you have successfully picked up the tracks of a creature, you are able to follow those tracks without any need for further checks for a period of up to 7 days.

- **SEE THE UNSEEN**
- 
Prerequisite: 5th level

Once between long rests you can focus your attention on peripheral sights, sounds, and other signs of unseen passage. For the next hour, you can detect invisible creatures and objects, their location, movement, and actions, and 
even sense creatures and objects in the Ethereal Plane.

### Archtypes

#### Gunslinger

- **FIGHTING STYLE: RANGED**: Starting at 3rd level when you select this archetype, you gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.
- **AUGMENTED SHOTS**: Also at 3rd level, you learn how to craft ammunition for the job at hand. At the end of each short rest , you can craft a number of augmented rounds equal to twice your proficiency bonus, each costing 1ch of materials and an equal amount of ammunition. When you craft each augmented round, kinetic, or energy damage. On a successful hit, the ammunition deals the usual amount of damage, but of the chosen type. Additionally, you can use a bonus action to affix an item of Tiny size that weighs 3 pounds or less and can be used as an improvised weapon (explosive charge) to the end of a piece of ammunition. This increases the item’s range to that of your weapon’s normal range and allows you to roll as though it were a ranged attack with which you are proficient, though it only deals the damage and effects of the item, not the ammunition utilized.
- **SIMPLE TRICK SHOTS**: Beginning at 7th level, you figure out how to shoot rounds that a common shooter couldn’t even load properly. At the end of each short rest, you can craft a number of trick rounds equal to your proficiency bonus, each costing 1 chit worth of raw materials, as well as an equal amount of ammunition (augmented rounds cannot be used for this purpose). When you craft each trick round, choose acid, cold, fire, lightning, or sonic, ion, or energy. On a successful hit, a trick round deals 1d8 damage of the chosen type (which counts as ~empowered~ for the purposes of overcoming resistance and immunity ) in addition to that of the ammunition. Due to their bulky nature, you can only use one trick round per attack action (though you can still make your remaining shots with normal ammunition) and can only hit targets within your weapon’s normal range. Additionally, the materials of a trick round are unstable and lose their efficacy when you next take a short rest , though the materials can be repurposed for a new trick round.
- **ADVANCED TRICK SHOTS**: Starting at 11th level, your understanding of the art of ranged combat yields even more incredible weaponry. When you craft a trick round, you may choose from force, necrotic, or radiant damage. In addition, on a critical hit the damage dice of extra damage from a trick missile increases from d8 to d12.
- **IMPOSSIBLE SHOTS**: At 15th level, you gain an additional number of uses for your Accuracy Bonus equal to your proficiency bonus. In addition, you can gain your Accuracy Bonus as a free action

#### Starbound Tracker

- **DECLARED ENEMY**: At 3rd level, you learn to focus your hunting abilities on ideological enemies. You may declare the humanoid forces of an organization, nation or faction as your Studied Adversary.
- **BLENDING IN**: Also at 3rd level you learn the tricks to lay low among civilian populations until the time comes to strike. You gain proficiency with the disguise kit and a single rare weapon with the stealthy property. You also gain advantage on Stealth and Deception checks to avoid the notice of any creatures that are searching for you.
- **CREATURE OF THE CITY**: At 7th level, you become adept at urban warfare. Choose a single settlement/colony/starport that you have occupied for at least a week. While within the limits of that city/settlement/colony/starport, you gain the benefits of your Familiar Terrain ability. You may only benefit from this feature in one settlement/colony/starport at a time. If you return to a settlement/colony/starport where you previously had these benefits, you decrease the time it takes to receive these benefits by a number of days equal to your proficiency bonus. Additionally, choose one of the following benefits.
  - **URBAN BOUNTY**: While in a settlement/colony/starport where Creature of the City applies, you may Hunt and Gather within the city/settlement/colony/starport, reflecting your stealing from the occupiers, foraging in waste bins, or receiving support from a friendly populace.
  - **HIDEOUT**: While in a settlement/colony/starport where Creature of the City applies, you gain free use of a city/settlement/colony/starport bolthole. It takes an hour to move the contents of your city/settlement/colony/starport bolthole to a new location.
- **DEFIANT WILL**: At 11th level you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.
- **SYMBOL OF RESISTANCE**: At 15th level, your legend has spread far and wide. Choose one of the following.
  - **INSPIRATIONAL**: You can make a speech at least 10 minutes long to a group of up to 30 friendly creatures. Creatures that hear your speech gain an expertise die on attack rolls against your Studied Adversary and on saving throws to resist being frightened or charmed . This effect lasts for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus.
  - **FEARSOME**: As a bonus action, you can spend a use of this ability to choose a Studied Adversary designated with your Declared Enemy ability to make a contested Intimidation check against. You are considered proficient in Intimidation for the purposes of this feature. On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your bonus action to spend another use of this feature and extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you. On a success, the creature is unaffected and is immune to being frightened by you in this manner for 24 hours.

Once you have used the chosen feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest .

#### Survivalist
- **UNARMORED DEFENSE**: At 3rd level when you select this archetype, you learn to keep yourself safe without the need for armor. While not wearing armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.
- **SELF-SUFFICIENT**: Also at 3rd level, you learn to rely on your advanced wilderness skills to see you through. Choose one of the following to be proficient in: Perception, Stealth, Survival, Nature. If you are already proficient, you can instead gain an expertise die. You also can fashion your own weapons. When in an area with the appropriate raw materials available (as determined by the Narrator), you can fashion one of the following over the course of a short rest with the aid of a combat knife or similar bladed implement: shortbow with 5 arrows, 20 arrows, club, greatclub, quarterstaff, spear. If you also have a sharp stone such as flint or obsidian available, you can fashion a combat knife, handaxe, without the use of a bladed implement. These weapons have the flaw property and any creature except you suffers disadvantage on attack rolls made with them.
- **TRAINED HUNTER**: Finally, at 3rd level you become especially adept at hunting local creatures. Choose one of the following creature types: beast, plant. You gain an expertise die on attack rolls made against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, when you deal damage to such a creature, it takes an additional 1d4 damage. At 7th level, this damage increases to 1d6 and this feature also applies to creatures with the beast, and plant types. At 15th level this damage increases to 1d8. Additionally, select one of the following creature types: aberration, or undead. This feature now also applies to the chosen creature type.
- **WILDERNESS SPECIALIZATION**: Beginning at 7th level, your skills increase. Choose one of the following journey activities: Harvest, Hunt and Gather, Scout, Track. When you perform the chosen activity, treat your result as one category higher than normal. Critical failures count as failures, failures become successes, and successes become critical successes. Critical successes have no additional effect.
- **RESILIENT**: At 11th level, you gain proficiency in Constitution saving throws .
- **CAREFUL STEPS**: At 15th level, you are incredibly light on your feet. While unarmored, your walking speed increases by 10 feet, and while in a natural environment you gain advantage on all Acrobatics, Athletics, and Stealth checks.

You begin the game with 1250 chits which you can spend on your character’s starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear. You can select your own gear.

### MEDICAL EXPLOITS
As a medic, you gain exploits you can use to aid allies or hinder enemies. Mechanically, these are identical to spells. Exploits require both the use of your hands and appropri- ate materials to perform. Unlike spells, medical exploits require neither contemplation nor studying each morning; you regain the use of them each day without effort. You do not need to choose which exploits to prepare ahead of time. You can employ any exploit on the list of a level that you can use.

At 1st level, you also know two medical applications of your choice from the medical application list. These are at- will abilities you can use as long as you have the necessary materials and action to perform them. You learn additional applications of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the medical applications column of the medic table. The medic table shows how many slots you have to use your exploits of 1st level and higher. To enact one of these exploits, you must expend a slot of the exploit’s level or higher. You regain all expended exploit slots when you fin- ish a long rest.

Exploit save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier 

Exploit attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Kits. Many exploits and applications require the use of either a medical kit or a biochemistry kit. A medical kit has enough supplies for 50 actions, while the biochemistry kit has enough for 10 actions. This is regardless of how many targets are af- fected by said action

### TARGET AVOIDANCE
Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you can take a Dash action. At 2nd level, as a bonus action, you can instead take a Disengage action.

### PRIMARY TARGET
Starting at 1st level, if you don’t make an Attack action on your turn, you gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. At 5th level, this bonus increases to +3.

### ARCHTYPE
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### MEDICAL EMERGENCY
Starting at 6th level, once per turn (on your turn), you can activate one medical application requiring an action or bonus action as a free action.

### INTELLIGENT RESISTANCE
Starting at 10th level, you gain an expertise dice with all Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

### RISK AN ANEURYSM
Starting at 13th level, instead of using your Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest, you can expend them on your turn to recover a medical exploit of any level you can use. You must employ that exploit within 1 minute or it is lost. You regain one level of exploit slot for each Hit Die sacrificed, but you can only recover one slot per turn. For example, if you spend 4 Hit Dice, you can recover a 4th- level slot.

### EXPANDED KNOWLEDGE
At 17th level, select two more skills from your class list to have proficiency in.

### GOOD THING YOU HAVE FRIENDS
At 20th level, you gain the ability to use allies for cover. For each ally within 5 feet of you, you can increase the level of cover you have. One ally half cover; two allies three-quarters cover; three allies full cover. If you are still hit with an attack, you can transfer all damage to any single adjacent ally regardless if the original attack roll can hit the ally or not. If the attack targets you and the ally, the ally takes both damage values, taking your damage second. The ally does not have to be willing.

You also learn if the item has any sentience or bears a curse, though you only learn if it is sentient or cursed (not the nature of that sentience or curse). 

### ARCHETYPE FEATURE
At 7th level you gain another archetype feature.

### INDOMITABLE
At 9th level, you can draw upon your indomitable will to overcome pain, resist overwhelming forces, or retaliate  when most warriors would be shirking back. You can use this feature to perform any of the following reactions:

Reroll a failed saving throw . If you do so, you must use the new roll.
Reduce the damage you would take from a single source or attack by 2d8 + half your mercenary level (rounded down).  
Make a single attack against a creature that has just completed an attack against you.
You gain an additional use of this feature at 13th level and a third use starting at 17th leveI. You regain all spent uses of this feature whenever you finish a long rest .

### REPUTATION
At 10th level, your reputation has begun to precede you. Choose one of the following options:

- **INSPIRING**: You’re a reputed leader, a person to be trusted whose words are to be heeded. You gain an expertise die on Persuasion checks. In addition, you may spend 1 exertion point as a bonus action to inspire a creature that can hear you. The creature makes an Insight check opposed by your Persuasion check, becoming inspired by you on a failure. Indifferent creatures you inspire in this way become friendly towards you and your allies, and friendly creatures you inspire in this way will consider you an ally and may provide you with local information that would otherwise remain secret. Creatures will remain inspired by you indefinitely unless you do something that would make them hostile or lose confidence in you, such as lying, stealing, or causing them or their allies harm, or being proven cowardly or untrustworthy in any way. 

- **INTIMIDATING**: You’re reputed to be a terror to your foes and a fearsome ally. You gain an expertise die on Intimidation checks. In addition, you can use a bonus action and spend 1 exertion point to intimidate one creature you can see. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or becomes frightened of you for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, a frightened creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- **LEGENDARY**: Your deeds have become epic stories, growing bigger and more outlandish with each retelling. You gain an expertise die on Deception checks. In addition, you can spend 1 exertion point to weave your real legendary deeds into a Persuasion check as boasting, or include fabricated legendary deeds into a Deception check. When you do so, you have advantage on the check. 

### ARCHETYPE FEATURE
At 10th level you gain another archetype feature.

### WAR’S TOLL
At 14th level, your experiences have left their impressions on you. All the lives ended—both friends and foes—inevitably weighs down on a person, and each must find their own way to cope and pay the toll of war. Choose one of the following.

- **BATTLE SCARRED**: You’ve embraced every victory and loss, and you wear each battle scar like a badge of honor. Whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points you gain a new permanent scar or mark, and you gain inspiration. Once you gain inspiration in this way you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest .

- **CAROUSER**: You cope through drink and revelry, and have mastered both. You can gain the benefits of a long rest by spending 4 hours drinking, carousing, and taking the occasional blackout nap. You can carouse in this way so long as you consume at least 4 pint’s worth of ale (or equivalent drink), and you are alert and aware of your surroundings while doing so. If you carouse with another creature in this way, you can attempt to learn secrets from it by drinking it under the table. Each hour you spend carousing with a willing creature, make an opposed Constitution check. On a success, that creature answers a question truthfully (even questions it would not normally answer). In addition, you can enjoy alcohol as normal but can’t gain the poisoned condition from it. This feature has no effect on creatures that are immune to the poisoned condition.  

- **ONE EYE OPEN**: Your life has been so regularly in danger that you’ve learned to literally sleep with one eye open. You are alert and aware of your surroundings while sleeping during long rests . You can also never be surprised and you gain an expertise die on initiative checks.

### MARTIAL LEGACY

At 18th level, your mastered maneuvers have become as natural as breathing, and you have the opportunity to pass your techniques down to the next generation. By spending 8 hours sparring, you can teach another willing 
creature a maneuver you have mastered using Maneuver Specialization. A creature must be proficient in at least one combat tradition to learn a maneuver in this way, it can only learn maneuvers of a degree from which it already 
knows at least one maneuver, this counts against its numbers of maneuvers known.


### ARCHETYPE FEATURE
At 18th level you gain another archetype feature.

### WARMASTER
At 20th level, you have become an undisputed master of battle. You gain the following features.

- **MASTER OF COMBAT**: You master every maneuver you know and any future maneuvers you learn as per Maneuver Specialization. Additionally, choose one maneuver of 3rd degree or less that you know. You are able to use the chosen 
maneuver without expending any exertion points.


- **FINISHING BLOW**: You can make spectacular, devastating attacks which inspire awe in those nearby. When you miss with a weapon attack while taking the Attack action, you can choose to hit instead. Alternatively, you can choose to change a hit with a weapon attack into a critical hit, or when you score a critical hit you can choose to deal maximum damage. All hostile creatures who see your Finishing Blow make a Wisdom saving throw against your maneuver DC or become frightened for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest .

### SOLDIERING KNACKS
When you gain access to a new soldiering knack, choose one of the following.

- **AMPHIBIOUS COMBATANT**: You gain a swimming speed equal to your Speed, and may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution check related to aquatic activity (such as Athletics checks to swim, Acrobatics checks to keep balance on a ship’s deck, or Constitution checks to hold your breath). You may choose whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, you add your proficiency bonus to the number of minutes you can hold your breath before suffocating, and can spend 1 exertion to hold your breath for an additional minutes equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **CAMPAIGNER**: You have the ability to go for the long haul, carrying heavy equipment across long distances. You double your Strength score when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can lift, push, or drag. You may also add your proficiency bonus to the number of hours you can march before you risk fatigue from a forced march.
- **CLEARSIGHT SENTINEL**: You gain darkvision. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. In addition, you do not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in lightly obscured areas (such as in light fog, moderate foliage, or heavy precipitation).
- **EXTREME LEAP**: When you take the Dash action and make a long jump after moving no less than 20 feet, your jump distance is doubled for the turn. You may spend 1 exertion to triple your jump distance for the turn instead, and may move the full distance of your jump even if it exceeds your Speed.
- **MOUNTAINEER**: You gain a climbing speed equal to your Speed, and may spend 1 exertion to reroll a failed Athletics check to climb, choosing whether to use the new roll or the original. In addition, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

- **STABLE FOOTING**: A steady stance and careful footwork is instinctive to you. You have advantage on any check or saving throw to avoid falling prone or handle difficult ground (such as against a grease ~~spell~~{power} or slippery ice). You are never prone after taking fall damage, and when calculating fall damage you treat the fall distance as if it were shorter by a number of feet equal to your proficiency bonus × 10.
- **WEATHER BEATEN**: Exposed to all kinds of weather over your life, you are inured to all but the most deadly effects. You gain advantage on saving throws against cold and hot weather, as well as any adverse effects from wind or precipitation.

### ARCHTYPES

#### MARKSMAN

- **CRACK SHOT**: At 3rd level, your training with ranged weapons grants the following benefits:
  - You do not have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls due to being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range.
-   Your ranged weapon attack rolls ignore half cover and three-quarters cover .

- **MARKSMAN TRADITIONS**: Also at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat traditions of your choice: Biting Zephyr, Razor’s Edge, Unending Wheel. When you gain this feature you may choose one of the 
maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from your newly chosen combat tradition.  

- **FOCUS SHOT**: At 7th level, you’ve become precise enough that when given enough time to focus you can not only strike your target, but hit specific parts of your target to great effect. Once per turn, whenever you take the 
Attack action and are able to make multiple ranged attacks you may forgo one of those ranged attacks to turn one of your remaining attacks into a Focus Shot. When you make a Focus Shot choose one of the following options and make a ranged weapon attack. You gain an expertise die on the attack, and on a hit it does your chosen effect in addition to the weapon’s damage.
- Aim for the Eyes. You aim for the creature’s weak and delicate eyes. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC or is blinded until it recovers.
- Bring it Down. You aim for weak points on the creature’s legs. The target makes a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC or its Speed is reduced by half until it recovers.

- Wing Clip. You aim for your target’s wings. The target makes a Dexterity saving throw against your maneuver DC. On a failure, its flying speed is reduced by half until healed. Creatures who are currently flying when this saving throw is failed immediately plummet 60 feet down and take falling damage as normal.   

Creatures wounded by any of these effects make a Constitution saving throw against your maneuver DC at the end of each of their turns, recovering and ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the wounded creature (or a creature within 5 feet of it) can use an action to make a Medicine check against your maneuver DC, ending the effect on a success. Healing ~~magically~~ or from a trait (such as Regeneration) also ends the effect. You cannot choose effects that specifically target features a creature does not have. 

- **HAWKEYE**: At 10th level, you have become incredibly observant and alert. You gain an expertise die on Investigation and Perception checks, and when rolling initiative.

- **DEAD EYE**: At 18th level, you can hit miniscule targets at ludicrous ranges with seemingly impossible accuracy. Whenever you take the Attack action and are able to make multiple ranged attacks, you may forgo all of those ranged attacks except for one to turn that remaining attack into a Critical Shot, making a ranged weapon attack with advantage . If your Critical Shot hits it becomes a critical hit.

#### GUNFIGHTER

- **DUELING TRADITIONS**: At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in one of the following combat traditions of your choice: Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, Rapid Current. When you gain this feature you can choose one of the 
maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree or lower from your newly chosen combat tradition.  

- **PANACHE**: Also at 3rd level, you’ve learned to use just the right words and mannerisms instead of exerting yourself to turn the tide of battle. Whenever you would spend exertion points on a duelist feature or a maneuver 
from the Mirror’s Glint, Mist and Shade, or Rapid Current combat traditions, you may reduce the exertion point cost of that maneuver or feature by 1 (minimum 0). Once you have used this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest .

- **SWORDLORD'S CHALLENGE**: At 10th level, you’re confident enough to challenge even the most monstrous threats. You can use a bonus action to expend a use of Panache to challenge a creature within 30 feet to an honorable duel. Once you challenge a creature in this way, you have disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than the challenged creature, and the challenged creature has disadvantage on attacks against creatures other than you. A creature remains challenged in this way until either you or the challenged creature are incapacitated , dies, or either ends their turn out of line of sight from the other. The challenge also ends if you use this feature again to challenge a different creature, or if a third creature challenges either you or your challenged creature.
- **ELUSIVE**: At 15th level, you can move effortlessly and untouched through any battlefield. Your movement out of a creature’s threatened area does not provoke opportunity attacks . In addition, whenever you parry an attack using a parrying weapon the expertise die to your AC increases by one stage.
- **MASTER SWORDLORD**: At 18th level, you’ve truly mastered the art of the duel. You have advantage on melee weapon attacks against creatures currently challenged using your Duelist’s Challenge feature.

### CLASS FEATURES
As a technician, you gain the following class features.

- **HIT POINTS**
  - Hit Dice: 1d8 per technician level
  - Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier
  - Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per technician level after 1st

- **PROFICIENCIES**
- Armor: Light armor, medium armor
- Weapons: Simple weapons, one handed martial weapons
- Tools: All ground and aircraft vehicles, Engineer's Kit, Mechanics Kit
- Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom
- Skills: Engineering; select four skills from Lore, History, Insight, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Perception, Performance

- **EQUIPMENT**
You begin the game with 1000 chits which you can spend on your character’s starting weapons, armor, and adventuring gear. You can select your own gear.

### TECH POINTS
At 1st level, you get tech points (TP) that can be used to boost abilities and perform exploits representative of your training. At 1st level, you start with points equal to 3 + your Intelligence modifier, which increases by 1 every additional level. Any spent tech points are recovered after you finish a long rest.

### SHINY RED BUTTON
At 1st level, you can put a button on your firearm/energy weapon/energy weapon/energy weapon. You only need eight hours of work to put the button on a new firearm/energy weapon/energy weapon but only you can press it without breaking the weapon. The button’s function is determined by your choices from the options that follow. You can add as many functions into your button as you have available tech points, but each modification can only be added once per configuration unless stated otherwise. If you don’t alter the function outside of a battle, your last configuration is used (if you have the available points).

Pressing the button takes no action. When you press the button, you spend the tech points corresponding with each of the functions added. If you don’t have enough tech points when you press the button, the entire configuration does not function. Once pressed, its effects last five minutes.

You can own multiple weapons with different configurations, as the points are not spent unless the button is pushed, though pushing multiple buttons during a single battle would be rather wasteful. Changing a configuration takes five minutes, though you can attempt to change a configuration as an action with a DC 15 Intelligence (Engineering) check (you can not change a configuration while one is in effect without voiding the invested tech points of the previous configuration).

Additionally, you can attempt to regain a lost tech point with a DC 5 Intelligence (Engineering) check. Each check takes 1 minute, and successive checks increase the DC by 5 (DC 10, DC 15, etc.). The DC increases regardless if you succeed in recovering the point or not, and the check reverts back to DC5 when you take a long rest.

#### CHARGE SHOT
Cost. 1 or 2 points

Each time you hit a target your size or smaller, you shove it 5 feet. If the target cannot be shoved, it takes 1d6 additional damage. You can add this modification twice to push the target 10 feet and increase the damage to 2d6. Larger creatures are unaffected.

#### EXPLOSIVE ROUND
Cost. 1 point

When you score a critical hit, you roll all damage dice thrice instead of twice.

#### FLOATING RETICLE
Cost. 2 points

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls

#### HYDROSHOCK
Cost. 2 or 4 points

You deal additional damage with a hit equal to the differ- ence between your attack roll and the target’s AC to a max- imum of 4. Add this modification a second time to increase the maximum to 8.

#### INCREASED CALIBER
Cost. 2, 4, or 6 points

Your weapon’s damage gains a +2 bonus. This stacks with any other effects that increases damage. You can add this modification up to three times.

#### INCREASED ROUND VELOCITY
Cost. 2 points

You double the rate of fire of your weapon. If targeting single creatures, your weapon’s damage bonus increases by +2. This stacks with any other effect that increases this damage bonus.

#### MUZZLE FLASH
Cost. 1 point

When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die, you can reroll. You must accept the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2.

#### POP-UP EYEPIECE
Cost. 2 points

Any creature you hit within 20 feet of you has disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the beginning of your next turn.

#### RAPID LOADER
Cost. 1 point

If you roll a 2 or 3 on your attack roll, you can re-roll. You must accept the second result.

#### SMART TRACKING
Cost. 4 or 8 points

You gain one additional attack whenever you take the At- tack action on your turn. You can add this modification up to two times. This stacks with Pioneer.

#### TARGET SCANNING
Cost. 6 points

You have advantage on attack rolls.

#### TARGET SCANNING
Cost. 3 points

Your weapon scores a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

### TECH SAVANT
Starting at 1st level, you gain one of the following traits that reflect the uniqueness of your talents. Some require the spending of tech points. You gain additional tech savant traits at 2nd level, 5th level, 10th level, 13th level, 17th level, and 20th level.

- **Economical Plating**: You gain a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, you can temporarily increase your armor’s potential, spending one tech point as an action to increase your AC an additional +1 for five minutes.
- **Failsafe**: If someone other than you attempts to use your weapon with a shiny red button on it (regardless if they press it), the weapon explodes, inflicting a critical hit of weapon damage on the unlucky handler and stunning them until the beginning of your next turn. The weapon is now broken (it can be fixed normally).
- **Friggin’ Love Science**: Spend a tech point, and you have advantage on Intelligence (Engineer) checks until the end of your next turn. If you select this trait a second time, you can spend one tech point to set your next d20 roll Intelligence (Engineer) check to a natural 20.
- **Immediacy**: Spend one tech point as a bonus action to gain an additional action on this turn. This action can be used to take any action except an Attack action. 
- **Like Machines**: Your maximum tech points increase by 2. You can select this trait up to four times. 
- **Midas Touch**: While you are wielding a firearm/energy weapon, your damage bonus increases by +2. You can select this trait twice, and its effects stack with others that increase this damage bonus.
- **Priorities**: Instead of using your Hit Dice to recover hit points during a short rest, you can expend them to regain tech points. For each Hit Die spent, you recover 2 tech points rather than recover hit points. You cannot have more tech points than your maximum.
- **Scientist, Not A Soldier**: When you use the Disengage action, you can also make a single ranged attack as part of the same action. You inflict half damage on a hit.
- **Shrapnel Modification**: You can now spend tech points in combat for an immediate boost to the weapon with your shiny red button while it is active. Spend 1 tech point after you hit, and the target is vulnerable to ally attacks until the beginning of your next turn.

### WIDGET BAG
Starting at 1st level, you gain a widget bag. It contains ran- dom spare parts, useful materials, and salvage worth 200ch. During a short or long rest, you can scavenge for components. In most areas, you will be able to recover 10ch worth during a short rest and 20ch worth during a long rest, but the GM may award more or less (or none at all) at her discretion.

### ARCHTYPE
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, 15th, and 18th level.

### ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT
When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 us- ing this feature.
### PIONEER
Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. This increases to three attacks at 14th level in this class.

### MCGUY SOMETHING
Starting at 12th level, you can construct useful items or tools to accomplish something generally not allowed given the available resources available. Either the GM can supply a random assortment of items you can use to create a tool, or you can make a case for everyday items one is likely to find to solve an immediate crisis. This may involve searching an area or assuming certain items are available; if your widget bag currently contains at least 20ch worth of parts, you can always be assumed to have a variety of small useful items such as screws, nails, paper clips, duct tape, and chewing gum. If the GM is convinced by your argument, make an Intelligence (Engineering) check to see if the improvised gadget or solution works (Set the GM). When you use this trait, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

### ARCHTYPES

#### FIELD MACHINIST
You are a troubleshooter. Without you, the others don’t amount to much more than a bunch of poorly equipped primitives with clubs. You improvise when needed, solving most mechanical problems when they arise. You are the master of jury-rigging solutions when others consider a problem hopeless. You are resourceful, intelligent, but generally non-violent. You possess a background in physical sciences. You are a walking, talking Swiss army knife.

- **KIT MASTERY**: Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you get expertise in Intelligence (Engineering) checks this can go above 1d12. You gain another expertise which can go above 1d12.
- **FRANTIC REPAIR**: Starting at 7th level, you treat all tool kits as one tech level higher. This increases to two levels at 15th level. Starting at 11th level, you can attempt to repair broken items as an action. Additionally, your progress in crafting any technology is doubled.
- **COVERED IN GREASE**: Starting at 15th level, all technology you build costs 15% less (and thus takes 15% less time, round down). 
- **PURE ENGINEER**: Starting at 18th level, you can set an Intelligence (Engineering) check you made to a natural 20. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, whenever you roll a natural 1 on an Intelligence (Engineering) check, re-roll until the result is anything except a natural 1.

#### INFANTRY SUPPORT SPECIALIST
You are not placed on this world to lead. You support those that have earned your loyalty. You carry the largest weapons and know-how to employ them effectively without endangering the lives of your allies. Your only weakness is your speed. Being the heaviest hitter has also often made you the slowest. Your abilities are based upon lying down heavy fire and preventing the approach of invading forces.

- **Bonus Proficiency**: Heavy Weapons

- **WEAPONS PLAYFORM**: Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, if you don’t move on your turn, you can plant your feet to stabilize your position. You cannot use your speed to move until the beginning of your next turn. Until the beginning of your next turn, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with burst or heavy ranged weapons. Saving throw DCs against your burst or heavy ranged weapon attacks also increase by 1.
- **FOCUSED BARRAGE**: Starting at 7th level, if using an burst or heavy ranged weapon, at the end of your turn, you can make a single ranged attack against one target you have already hit that same turn as a bonus action.
- **LAWNMOWER BARRAGE**: Starting at 11th level, you can move 5 feet without incurring attack penalties with two-handed ranged martial weapons and heavy ranged weapons. You can also plant a heavy weapon as a bonus action.
- **THE MEAN ONE**: Starting at 15th level, all opponents within 20 feet of you suffer disadvantage on any attack that doesn’t include you, and you gain a +3 bonus to damage rolls with ranged weapons against them.
- **FULL SEND**: Starting at 18th level, you can use an action to make a single ranged attack against each enemy in range you can see. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest. If no targets are hit by this ac- tion, you regain the use of this feature.

#### COMBAT ENGINEER
Combat engineers have a long and respected history. You can be a bridge builder and a bridge destroyer. You approach bombs while others turn and run. With seconds on the clock, others give up while you take it as incentive.

- **THE LONG WALK**: Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have advantage on Intelligence (Engineering)[Demolitons] checks. Additionally, anytime you make an attack with a weapon with the EXPLOSIVE property (grenades, demotions, or rockets), you gain a damage bonus equal to your level. This includes both direct attack rolls and when imposing Dexterity saves.
- **RENDER SAFE PROCEDURES**: Starting at 7th level, if forced to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can move 5 feet as a reaction but before needing to roll (possibly escaping the area of effect).
- **SLIGHT CHEMICAL IMPROVEMENT**: Starting at 11th level, with an explosive attack (via a thrown grenade, planted explosive, or a weapon with the “explosive” property) with a blast radius of 10 feet or more, you increase the blast radius by another 5 feet.
- **PROPER APPLICATION**: Starting at 15th level, when determining the saving throw DC for explosives you set, double your Intelligence modifier. Additionally, if a target fails a saving throw against your explosives attack (via a thrown grenade, planted ex- plosive, or a weapon with the “explosive” property), increase the number of damage dice by two.
- **THE FRIES METHOD**: Starting at 18th level, your explosives tend to set off chain reactions. After you detonate an explosive, a lingering fire breaks out until the start of your next turn, dealing your Intelligence modifier + your level in fire damage to any targets entering or starting their turn in the affected area. The fire lasts for 1 minute.

### Battle Defense

Starting at 1st level, you decide on how best to protect yourself on the battlefield—relying on barbaric might or encased in weighty armaments. Choose one of the following options.

- **Juggernaut**

You gain proficiency with heavy armor. In addition, your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor, you can still benefit from raging while wearing heavy armor, and you do not count the weight of any worn armor when determining your carrying capacity.

- **Rugged Defense**

While you are not wearing any armor, your armor class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.

In addition, your speed increases by 5 feet while you aren’t wearing heavy armor. At 5th level, your speed increases by an additional 5 feet.

### Developed Talents

Whether in the ruins of an ancient civilization, the barren terrain of the hinterlands, or the back alleys of a prosperous city/settlement/colony/starport, berserkers are adept at surviving and interacting with their environments. 

At 1st level you gain a developed talent of your choice. Your developed talents are detailed at the end of the class description. The Talents Known column of the Warbringer table shows when you learn more developed talents.

### Rage

In battle, you give yourself over to the fury within. Starting at 1st level, on your turn you can use a bonus action to enter a rage.

- While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
-   You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws .
-   Every round that you remain in rage, at the start of your turn you gain a number of rage hit points that increases as you gain levels as a warbringer, as shown in the Rage Hit Points column of the Warbringer table. Whenever you take damage, you reduce your rage hit points first, then your regular hit points. Rage hit points stack each round until your rage ends, at which point they dissipate.
-   The maximum number of rage hit points you can have at one time is equal to 5 × your warbringer level.
-   You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
-   If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
-   You gain no benefit from temporary hit points.

While raging, you cannot choose to use the Fall Back reaction.

Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious . You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.

Once you have raged the number of times shown for your warbringer level in the Rages column of the Warbringer table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.

### Combat Maneuvers

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to use combat maneuvers. You gain proficiency in two combat traditions from the following list: Adamant Mountain, Mirror’s Glint, Rapid Current, Tempered Iron, Tooth and Claw. You learn two maneuvers of your choice from traditions you are proficient with.

You gain an exertion pool equal to twice your proficiency bonus, regaining any spent exertion at the end of a short or long rest. You use your maneuvers by spending points from your exertion pool. The Maneuvers Known 
column of the Warbringer table shows when you learn more maneuvers from a tradition you are proficient with, while the Maneuver Degree column shows the highest degree you can select maneuvers from at a given level.

Additionally, whenever you learn a new maneuver, you can choose one of the maneuvers you know and replace it with another maneuver of the same degree from a tradition you are proficient with.

### Danger Sense

At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger. You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can't be blinded , deafened , or incapacitated .

### Furious Critical

Also at 2nd level you learn to maximize the effects of your mightiest blows, empowering your critical hits. Choose one Furious Critical. At 4th level and every even warbringer level after, you learn an additional Furious Critical.

Simple damage isn’t all that a warbringer can deal in combat. With just the right application of force, a warbringer can inflict a number of conditions on their opponent. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to resist such effects is equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. The attack must use a melee weapon that has the Heavy, Two-Handed, or Versatile property. Each Furious Critical can only be taken once and only one Furious Critical can be used per critical hit, unless otherwise stated.

- **Blinding Maneuver**

Your attack flings debris into the target’s eyes, causes blood to run into their eyes, or otherwise impedes their vision. When you score a critical hit, the target is blinded for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus.

- **Deafening Blow**

The force of the blow leaves the target with a ringing sensation in their ears, muffling the world around them. When you score a critical hit, the target is deafened for a number of rounds equal to half your proficiency bonus. If the target attempts to perform a power it must make a Constitution saving throw in order to do so successfully. The DC equals 10 or half the damage the creature took from the attack that inflicted the condition, whichever number is higher. 

- **Disorienting Strike**

The force of your attack leaves your target seeing double. When you score a critical hit, your target treats all creatures as though they have half cover (+2 to AC, Dexterity saving throws , and ability checks made to hide). This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus and does not stack with subsequent critical hits.

- **Elemental Wrath**

Your fury is so great that it incites the very elements to join you. When you score a critical hit, after dealing damage the weapon that dealt the blow is charged with acid, cold, fire, or lightning, chosen when you take this 

- **Furious Critical.**

The weapon now deals an additional 1d6 damage of the chosen type. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your proficiency bonus and does not stack with successive critical hits.

This Furious Critical can be taken multiple times as you gain warbringer levels, increasing the damage each time; 2d6 at 10th level, 3d6 at 16th level, and 4d6 at 20th level.

- **Furious Momentum**

Seizing on the fervor of a well-struck blow, you use your fury to fight all the harder. When you score a critical hit, the next melee weapon attack you make before the end of your next turn is a critical hit on a roll of 17–20. Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you have finished a short rest . Alternatively, you can expend one use of Rage to use this feature. The effects of this Furious Critical can be combined with any other.

- **Inspiring Flair**

Your sheer competence inspires your companions. When you score a critical hit, choose a creature that can see you. That creature gains an expertise die on its next attack roll.

- **Jockeying Blow**

When you score a critical hit, you can move up to 30 feet. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks from the target of your attack. In addition, you gain advantage on any ability checks made to jump as part of this movement. The effects of this Furious Critical can be combined with any other. 

- **Knockdown Strike**

With the right angle, your attack knocks the target sprawling. When you score a critical hit, the target makes a Strength saving throw or is knocked prone . This Furious Critical can be taken a second time to combine its effects with Overbearing Hit.

- **Mighty Blow**

Prerequisite: 6th level

You know how to hit so it hurts the most. You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee weapon attack. This Furious Critical can be taken again at 13th level and 17th level.

- **Overbearing Hit**

The sheer strength behind your blow sends the target staggering backwards. When you score a critical hit, the target is pushed 15 feet away from you in a straight line. This Furious Critical can be taken a second time to increase this distance to 30 feet.

- **Pinning Strike**

The profound force of your blow breaks the environment, crumbling the stone beneath your target’s feet or knocking shattered timber over their legs. When you score a critical hit, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to your Furious Critical DC).

- **Relentless Attack**

Your blows fall down mercilessly. When you score a critical hit, you may immediately make an additional melee weapon attack (no action or reaction required). If this subsequent attack is also a critical hit, this feature can be activated again for a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. No other Furious Critical can be activated for these additional attacks.

- **Terrifying Force**

You focus your rage, unleashing a fear-inspiring strike. When you score a critical hit, each creature you choose within 60 feet that can see you makes a Wisdom saving throw or is frightened of you for a number of rounds equal to half your proficiency bonus. The effects of this Furious Critical can be combined with any other.

- **Vitalizing Force**

The thrill of your attack drives you to greater feats. When you score a critical hit your base speed increases by 20 feet for 1 minute or until you use this Critical Focus again.

### Versatile Exploration

Beginning at 3rd level, whenever you learn a new developed talent or replace an existing one, you can instead choose from mercenary soldiering knacks.

### Warrior Born

Also at 3rd level, the ways of combat that have come naturally to you bring new and unexpected lessons. Choose one of the following.

- **Agitate**

Many battles have taught you how to spot aggressive body language like a pursed eyebrow, tensed temple, or protruding vein, and you’ve mastered using these cues to unsettle others outside of combat. Make an Intimidation check opposed by the Insight check of a creature you can see and hear within 20 feet. On a success, you subtly press the creature to act out. What exactly the creature does—back away quickly, blurt out something compromising, draw a weapon, look towards a concealed or disguised companion, protectively touch something it is carrying—is at the GM's discretion.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest .

- **Fearsome Reputation**

Word spreads of your prodigious strength or how terrifying you can be in battle. Whenever you are in a settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport, at least one commoner approaches you with a modest gift or bribe and beseeches you to help settle a feud, move a large obstacle, or otherwise make use of your impressive might. In addition to their offering, they are eager to tell you about their home and neighbors.

- **Imposing Prowess**

When an ally you can see and hear makes a Deception or Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to support them with an intimidating display of strength or unsettling glower. Your ally rerolls the check, gaining an expertise die on the roll.

Once you have used this feature, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Archtype
For every warbringer there is the spark of rage, ready to be fanned to inferno. The ways they use it however and how it came to be there can differ wildly. Some call upon their bloodline for inner strength, while others force it to a point of furious focus; many attribute it to the spirits that surround them. Still more gain their fury from a far more mundane source, such as betrayal or ill-treatment.

At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that defines the source of your rage. Warbringer archetypes are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Crushing Blows

By 5th level your martial prowess is such that you are able to land attacks to best effect, dealing devastating amounts of damage. Your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

At 12th level, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18–20.

At 17th level, your melee weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 17–20.

### Extra Attack

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Martial Presence

At 6th level your methodology to battle seeps further into the way you interact with others—and how they interact with you. Choose one of the following:

- **Forceful**

People respond favorably to your vigor. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Persuasion checks.

In addition, in every settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport you visit you inspire a number of followers equal to your proficiency bonus. Your followers perform minor tasks to help you while you are there, feed you and your allies, carry your belongings to nearby destinations, share their mount animals, reveal some of their secrets to try and gain your favor, and ask you for help before turning to the authorities with a problem

- **Mighty**

You turn your toughness into a tool when imposing upon others. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Intimidation checks. 

In addition, when you enter a tavern or other social gathering, you can make a DC 15 Intimidation check while loudly declaring that you are looking for something or someone. On a success, most of the people there look at and otherwise point out whoever they believe is the person you are looking for or the person most likely to know about what you are seeking.

- **Scary**

It’s commonly thought that it’s best not to ask you for too much clarification or detail. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Deception checks.

In addition, when you fail a Deception check against a creature, it makes a Wisdom saving throw against a DC equal to your passive Deception score. On a failure, it thinks twice about your dishonesty and your Deception check becomes a success

### Archetype Feature

At 6th level you gain another archetype feature.

### Advanced Battle Defense

By 7th level you have doubled down on your battle defense style. Choose one of the following.

- **Enhanced Vitality**

Choose Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. When you make the chosen saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you can choose to instead make a Constitution saving throw.

- **Preternatural Agility**

You can evade danger to an unbelievable degree. When you make a Dexterity saving throw against an effect that deals half damage on a success, you take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

- **Battle Moxie**

At 9th level, your experiences in combat teach you more about how to live in the world. Choose one of the following.

- **Provoking Attitude**

You know how to piss people off. You can expend one use of Rage and choose a creature within 60 feet that can hear or see you. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw against your Furious Critical DC. On a failure, it makes or accepts a challenge. The nature of this challenge is at the GM's discretion but is usually a duel or opposed check: archery with Dexterity, arm-wrestling with Strength, competing with a gaming set, distance running with Constitution, wrestling with Athletics, and so on. 

- **Roaring Pause**

When initiative is rolled you can expend one use of Rage to make an Intimidation check (DC 8 + number of creatures that rolled initiative) to briefly unveil the boundless fury within in a furious roar. On a success each creature stops what it is doing and can only make statements and a Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion check on its turn. On a success by 5 or more initiative is rerolled, and you choose a number of creatures equal to your Constitution modifier to gain advantage on their initiative roll.

- **Takes One To Know One**

You know another warrior when you see one. When you see a creature, you know if it is proficient with more than simple weapons or has access to combat maneuvers

### Archetype Feature

At 10th level you gain another archetype feature.

### School of the Open Road

At 11th level your journeys have given you a wealth of practical experience and helpful bits of information. Choose one of the following.
- **Don’t Get Fooled Again**

You’ve heard and seen (and perhaps told) enough lies that you spot them as easily as tells in battle. You can always choose to use Constitution for Insight checks and gain an expertise die when rolling to detect a falsehood.

In addition, you are seen as an arbiter of truth by those who have heard of your reputation and you may be called in to mediate a trial or question a suspected wrong-doer, even in larger settlements.

- **Storyteller**

You have an ear for interesting events, places, and people of the past. You can always use Constitution when making History checks and gain an expertise die when the subject has something to do with war, battle, or martial prowess.

In addition, your reputation means that people assume that you want to know the history (or perhaps gossip) of the settlement/colony/starport/colony/starport you’re visiting. When you are at a tavern or social gathering they are likely to approach you with tales of the baroness’ last stand 50 years ago, or mention ‘history in the making’ in the form of the Duke’s child being rumored to be a werewolf. Mechanical bonuses are at the GM's discretion but could include gaining an expertise die on Insight checks made against a particular NPC, or advantage on checks when seeking out a local tomb.

- **Trial and Error**

Between learning from both your own mistakes and those of others, you’ve collected a considerable knowledge about the natural world. You can always choose to use Constitution when making Nature checks and gain an expertise die on checks made to identify a plant or beast.

In addition, people see you as someone who loves a good survival story. When you are at a tavern or social gathering they are likely to approach you with information about local hazards or wildlife. This insight grants boon at the GM's discretion, such as gaining an expertise die on Survival checks to track a creature, additional beneficial effects from using a medicinal , or advantage on checks made to know a beast or plant creature’s weakness.

### Notable Reputation

At 13th level your name has spread far and wide, gaining you the respect of even important figures you’ve yet to meet. Choose one of the following.

- **Armed Assistance **

Mercenary groups make a point of making your acquaintance, especially in larger towns. As part of their hospitality they feed you and your companions, and provide a safe place to sleep, as well as offer to trade information and word of any jobs your group may be interested in.
