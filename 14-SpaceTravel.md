# 14. Space Travel
Space Travel in Astra Genesis takes two modes. 

- Interstellar: Traveling between the stars
- Interplanetary: Traveling inside a Solar System

Ships have two

1. Sublight Engines
2. Jump Drive

- **Sublight Engines**: 
Ships use their Sublight engines up to about hald the speed of light, that is considered "Standard" this is generally used to enter orbit, travel to moons, nearby planets, and around a planet to approach for landing. The Sublight engines are also used to accelerate leading into engaging the Jump Drive which maintains the ships velocity while in Jumpspace, and upon exiting.

Most Sublight Engines use a stable Helium fuel called, Helium-3. 

In game terms because the positons of planets always vary on any given time it is handled this way:

| Destination                         | Time       |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- |
| From planet to orbit                | 5 minutes  |
| From orbit to land                  | 5 minutes  |
| From orbit to a moon                | 10 minutes |
| In Solar System                     | 1d4 hours  |
| From planet to a safe jump distance | 3 minutes  |

- **Jump Drive**: 
The standard for Interstellar travel is the Jump Drive. Not all of them are made the same. This is a fantastical type of travel.

Understanding how a Jump Drive Works. A Jump Drive opens an Einstein-Rosen bridge between two points, more specifically it opens the far end of an event horizon some distance away and your trip enters Jumpspace. Travel in Jumpspace is fairly predictable but not well understood even by the best Astrophycicists in the Galaxy(ies).

-  How far you can jump depends on the rating of the Jump Drive, but all Jump Drives have a few things in common.
- They use 1 Unit of Trioxinide 
- They need to recharge after a jump and the recharge is a constant
  - A jump covers 1 Parsec, a Jump Drive must recharge 1 hour per Parsec jumped but it can jump as soon as it has at least 1 charge and is not required to jump its full distance
- They jump avariable distance up to a maximum controlled by the rating of the Drive
- 1 Rating = 1 Hex/Parsec (at Sector level)

A Jump Drive has a Rating from 1-9. The current tech level of the Galaxy is around TL 14 so the best most ships have is a Mk-5 Jump Drive.

> Setting Designer. It is inefficient to try to run a large Jump Drive to transport fleets or large so factions like the UTE use Star Carriers. Their larger ships latch on to the carrier and it jumps for them allowing the more combat focused ships to spend their energy and building space on what matters. 


- Initiating a Jump
  - An astorgation calculation takes a Astrogation check which is an Intelligence (Engineering) check and the DC is 10, 1 calculation is required per Parsec being jumped. 
  - If a character is under no real stress and has time to spend they can complete these automatically at 10 minutes per check
  - If under stress like combat factors may make the checks fmoe difficult
  - An AI cannot make the calculations for them but most ships have a Navcomputer bonus to the roll.

- Interplanetary Travel
This is accomplished via Sublight engines. Different species use different methods from Ion Drives, to Fusion Drives, etc. All of them accomplish the same thing they push a ship in a forward direction at speed very near the speed of light, near enough to not matter. Thanks to inertial dampeners this is not really a problem for people inside.
