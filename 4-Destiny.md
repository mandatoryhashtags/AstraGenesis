##### DESTINY

</div>



Every hero has something that drives them forward, an inner spark or outward goal that compels them to risk everything for a life of adventure. Choosing a destiny provides important roleplaying cues and features that help shape your character’s identity. Why are they an adventurer? What drives them into a life of danger? Is destiny thrust upon them by circumstance, or do they have a burning desire for a future they wish to claim for their own?

## Motivation
Each destiny has a table of example motivations that represents the heart of your character’s desire to be an adventurer. Feel free to select a motiva- tion, determine one randomly, or create one that you feel matches the destiny.

## Inspiration
The Narrator awards inspiration, a resource which grants you an edge in important moments, when you roleplay your character according to your destiny. Each destiny has a source of inspiration which describes acts of roleplaying that should be rewarded with inspiration (although it remains at the Narra- tor’s discretion). Additionally, the Narrator can award inspiration whenever they feel a character has been particularly clever, engaging, or heartfelt in their roleplaying.

Once you have inspiration, you can save it indef- initely. Whenever you or an ally you can see makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may spend your inspiration to grant advantage to that roll.

Alternatively, you can spend inspiration to use the inspiration feature unique to your chosen destiny.

You either have inspiration or you don’t; if you already have inspiration and do something worth rewarding inspiration, you do not gain a second use of inspiration.

## Fulfilling Your Destiny
Each destiny includes a fulfillment feature that you gain when you achieve your destiny, a momentous event usually at the end of a major story arc in the narrative (indicated by the Narrator). Even if your destiny remains outside of your grasp, it is close enough at hand that you automatically gain its fulfillment feature when you reach 16th level. If you fulfill your destiny early in a campaign, at the Narrator’s discretion you may select an additional destiny. You retain your original destiny’s features and gain the source of inspiration and inspiration feature of your new destiny. You cannot gain a second fulfillment feature.

## Changing Your Destiny
Motives change over time, as do the stories we tell. Whenever you gain a class level, you may choose to change your destiny. You lose any features provided by your current destiny and select a new destiny, gaining its source of inspiration and inspiration features.

### CHAOS
Those destined for Chaos don’t live by the rules binding ordinary folk. They clash with authority and tradition all their lives, either in minor acts of subversion or outright rebellion. Tricksters are rarely mere rulebreakers—their ideology signals change for both the meek and mighty. 

- Source of Inspiration: Chaos. You sow disorder, play tricks, and subvert tradition. You gain inspiration whenever you successfully subvert law and order, so long as it benefits your allies or moves the story forward.

Successfully lie to or humiliate an authority figure, commit a punishable crime, indulge in base pleasures to ill-advised extremes.

- Inspiration Feature: Ingenious Doubletalk. Undaunted by momentary setbacks, you twist conversations in any direction with an inspired turn of phrase and confusing doubletalk that plays off bold lies and impertinent proposals as jokes, obfuscates or redirects accidentally slipped information, or quells outrage with diffusing flattery. Whenever you or a friendly creature you can hear fails a Deception or a Persuasion check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and undo any consequences of that failed check.

- FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY: You fulfill your destiny of Chaos when you overturn a world or cosmic order.

Greatly destabilize a nation or extremely large organization, subvert or trick a deity-level entity, upset the status quo for a vast number of people.

- Fulfillment Feature: Agent of Chaos. The whims of chaos flow through you and everything you do. Whenever you roll one or more dice to determine the damage of an attack or ~~spell~~{power} or the random effects of a ~~spell~~{power} or feature, you may choose to reroll those dice; if you do you must use the new rolls.

In addition, you gain the Chaotic alignment and emit a strong chaotic aura for the purposes of any feature, ~~spell~~{power}, or trait that detects or affects Chaotic creatures.

### COMING OF AGE
Not all heroes have a clear path ahead of them. Some are still finding their footing and are dreaming big all the same: of adventure, the open road, a chance to prove one’s worth, and having a life worth living.

- Special Feature: Finding Yourself. Sometimes it takes a journey to find yourself. You may exchange this destiny for another destiny at any time.

- Source of Inspiration: Yes to Adventure. You draw inspiration from setting out with adventure in front of you. You gain inspiration whenever you achieve a personal milestone.

Join a new guild or organization, travel somewhere new and far from home, accept a new major quest or mission, change worldviews and grow as a person.

- Inspiration Feature: Ready to Learn. You haven’t had training in everything but you’re determined to give it your all anyway. As a bonus action you may spend your inspiration to gain proficiency with a weapon, armor, skill, or tool for the next hour. 

- FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY: You fulfill your Coming of Age destiny when you complete the hero’s journey.

Return to your homeland after defeating an immense threat, become the leader of an organization you were lowly in, learn the truth of life through great hardship.

- Fulfillment Feature: Returned. With the journey complete, you finally know who you are—or rather who you became along the way. When you gain this feature, you immediately choose the fulfillment feature from another destiny. You gain the chosen fulfillment feature, which replaces this one.

| 6    | Young Love: Adventuring is sure to impress the object of your affections.   |

### DOMINION
An impostor seated on your throne, a land divided by civil strife, a feckless bureaucracy waiting to be gamed. Those with the Dominion destiny look at chaos and see opportunity. Some seek to return to their hand what is rightfully theirs, but others start with nothing and wish to accumulate influence and power however they may. Through shield and steel or cloak and dagger you reach out to claim your rightful seat of power—or a place in its shadows. The Dominion destiny is as varied as politics itself. Consult with the Narrator to come up with ideas for an ambition suitable to the setting and campaign.

- Source of Inspiration: Leadership. You draw inspiration from taking charge and directing what needs to be done. You gain inspiration whenever you lead by example or convince a group of NPCs to act against their own interests in order to complete a difficult task.

Settle a vitriolic argument, direct a large number of nonplayer characters to participate in the completion of a task, rally a multitude of people to a cause.

- Inspiration Feature: Studied Deliberation. With a level head and measured logic, you objectively determine the best path forward. You may spend your inspiration and a minute’s deliberation to determine the results of an upcoming plan of action (as the augury ~~spell~~{power}). 

- FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY: You fulfill your destiny of Dominion when you gain a dominion of your own.

Become the ruler of a nation, large city, or other sizable population, become a divine figure with numerous followers, reach the top of a massive organization.

- Fulfillment Feature: Absolute Power. Either through respect or fear you have become an uncontested ruler, and most simple orders you give are followed without question. You have advantage on checks made to influence your subjects.
In addition, you gain the Lawful alignment, and you emit a strong lawful aura for the purposes of any feature, ~~spell~~{power}, or trait that detects or affects Lawful creatures.

| 2   | Justice: It is your duty to overthrow tyrants and let justice prevail.             |
| 3   | Power: All that matters is that you have the final word.                           |
| 4   | Reform: The current order is irredeemable and it must be overturned.               |
| 5   | Reprisal: Those who oppressed you will suffer under your heel.                     |
| 6   | Control: The world is messy and you will craft a better one.                       |




### EXCELLENCE
Some are fated to be the best, the apex, the pinnacle of their craft that all others aspire to. Such perfection demands single-minded determination, unending resolve and focus, and the luck of innate talent. Those destined for Excellence impact the world—often at the cost of countless sacrifices along the way. 

- Source of Inspiration: Failure. Every failed attempt is a chance for growth and each time you fall you stand up stronger. You gain inspiration whenever the Narrator calls for you to make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw and the final result of the d20 roll is a natural 1.

- Inspiration Feature: Practiced Edge. A perfected technique is often the difference between victory and defeat. After you roll an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw but before you know the outcome, you may spend your inspiration to add a +5 bonus to that roll. 

- FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY: You fulfill your destiny of Excellence when you perform a crowning achievement in your field.

Create a masterpiece, defeat the master of your martial art, become famous for a glorious act of heroism, or become renowned as the best in your field.

- Fulfillment Feature: A Technique Perfected: You have achieved the apex in at least some small area of mortal ability. Choose an ability score, combat tradition. 

  - Ability Score: When you make an ability check using the chosen ability score and can add your proficiency bonus, you gain an expertise die.
  - Combat Tradition: Attacks you make using combat maneuvers from this tradition gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### KNOWLEDGE
You seek the philosopher’s stone, universal truths too vast and terrible for mortal minds to comprehend, or untold secrets hidden away from inquiring minds. Scholars and seekers of Knowledge research and pry, chipping away at their own ignorance until they reveal some fundamental truths of reality. 

- Source of Inspiration: Learning. You draw inspiration from research, understanding, and gaining new insights and data. You gain inspiration whenever you make an arcane, divine, scholastic, or scientific discovery.

Closely examine a previously unknown or rare creature or phenomenon, discover something thought to be a myth or impossible, learn new information after at least 8 hours studying from a source of knowledge such as a library, book, or powerful artifact.

- Inspiration Feature: Critical Evaluation. Drawing upon a lifetime of study, you leap to accurate conclusions with only preliminary findings. As a bonus action you may spend your inspiration to quickly evaluate a creature or item you can see and accurately determine one objective attribute of your choice.

When evaluating a creature in this way, you may determine its resistances , immunities , vulnerabilities , what languages it speaks, or its Armor Class.

When evaluating an item in this way, you may determine if it is magical, poisonous, cursed, trapped, or its approximate value.

- FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY: You fulfill your destiny of Knowledge when you have a true epiphany.

Learn the methods to do something thought impossible, discover a fundamental cosmic truth, learn the truth behind an ultimate secret.

- Fulfillment Feature: Converging Theories. Your understanding has bridged the gaps and you join what once was disparate into a unified scientific and spiritual theory. Your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores each increase by 2 and their maximums each become 22.

| 6   | Vindication: You’ll show them—you’ll show them all that you were right all along! |




### REVENGE
Someone or something has wronged you, and even the gods cannot shield them from your retribution. Your burning desire for Revenge fuels your plans and kindles your destiny. Was your ire sparked by a grave misunderstanding, a callous uncaring cruelty, or a wicked and personal transgression?

Source of Inspiration: Served Cold. You draw inspiration from the wails of those who have wronged you. You gain inspiration whenever you outwit a foe without the use of Deception or Persuasion checks. Successfully attack a surprised opponent, lead a foe into a prepared trap, trick an enemy into harming themselves or greatly benefiting you.

Inspiration Feature: Cloak and Dagger. You know how to avert suspicion when danger closes in. Whenever you or an ally you can see fail a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and undo any consequences of that failed check. 

FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY
You fulfill your destiny of Revenge when you achieve vengeance.

Kill, imprison, or dethrone whatever entity that you believe wronged you, come to terms with the focus of your wrath meaningfully and sate your desire for vengeance.

Fulfillment Feature: Retaliatory Reputation. It has become apparent that wronging you is decidedly unwise and those without a death wish instinctively fear you. While you are not incapacitated, you can use a bonus action to direct a threatening stare at any hostile creature within 20 feet of you. The creature must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to your Retaliatory Reputation for the next 24 hours.

| 6   | Family Ties: You are determined to prune away the rot from your family tree.  |

### SLAYER
There are many in the world who fight terrible evils to protect others. They battle back the clutching hand of death for another day, then enjoy a well-earned, peaceful retirement. For the Slayer, however, these battles are their calling—whether they like it or not. Such people may be fated to battle a powerful being and their minions, a specific kind of monster, like werewolves, or an entire category of creature, such as the undead. Consult with the Narrator to come up with a foe suitable to the setting and campaign.

Source of Inspiration: War of Attrition. You gain Inspiration whenever you strike a blow against an especially powerful creature related to your destiny (but not necessarily your specific destined foe).

Force the powerful enemy’s retreat, obtain an item important to their defeat, gain a significant insight into their location or intentions, defeat one of their trusted lieutenants.

Inspiration Feature: Slayer’s Gift.  Fighting the creatures of darkness hones both your mental and physical prowess. After you roll an ability check , attack roll , or saving throw but before you know the outcome, you may spend your inspiration to add a +5 bonus to that roll.

FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY
You fulfill your destiny as a Slayer when you defeat a specific and powerful creature connected to your fate.

Destroy Vashika, Queen of the Vampires, thwart the aboleth Birgamoz’s terrible plans of domination, imprison the Dread Knight Maza Dunn.

Fulfillment Feature: Eyes of the Slayer. You have stared the darkness in the eye and now few can meet your gaze. While you are not incapacitated , you can use a bonus action to fix any hostile creature within 20 feet of you with an unsettling look, seeming to stare into its very soul. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to your passive Intimidation score. On a failure, it is frightened until the end of its next turn. On a success, it is immune to this ability for 24 hours.

| 6   | Accidental Champion: You keep finding these enemies when you’re not looking for them.       |




### UNDERDOG
Some people strive towards their destiny while others are dragged there. Those fated to be Underdogs must battle adversity and survive against long odds, gradually growing into the heroes they never sought to become.

Source of Inspiration: Defiance. You draw inspiration from striking out against oppression, defying long odds, and placing hope in the impossible. You gain inspiration whenever you score a critical hit against a creature larger than you are, roll a natural 20 on a death saving throw, openly defy a powerful being, or succeed after taking a risk with long odds.

Loudly refuse the orders of a tyrant, follow through with a convoluted or risky plan, succeed at something you were extremely likely to fail.

Inspiration Feature: A Nose for Trouble. Get kicked around long enough and you start to know when trouble’s brewing. Whenever you or an ally you can see fails an Insight check, you can use your reaction to spend your inspiration and learn any information that would have been gained by a successful Insight check.

FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY
You fulfill your Underdog’s destiny when you finally overcome the odds.

Succeed at a nearly unattainable and grand task, complete a supposedly impossible quest, defeat an insurmountable foe, succeed at a dire endeavor where failure was all but guaranteed.

Fulfillment Feature: Expendable and Invulnerable. While being kicked around and batted from adventure to adventure, somehow you always seem to scramble out of the rubble. Whenever you would make a saving throw you may spend your inspiration to automatically succeed instead.

| 5   | Striving: Odds of success are slim but you would rather die than give up now.                      |
| 6   | Survival: Dangers abound and you’re just hoping to see the next sunrise.                           |

### WEALTH
Glittering chits holds the promise of luxuries and freedom from want, all wrapped with the exhilarating rush of acquisition. Of the countless people who spend their lives in pursuit of Wealth some are just shrewd, clever, or brave enough to achieve their destiny. 

Source of Inspiration: Profits. You draw inspiration from spoils both easily gained and hard fought. You gain inspiration whenever you acquire substantial wealth.

Gain currency or property worth at least 1000 times your character level in chits, receive a ~~magic~~ item that is uncommon or rarer without purchasing it.

Inspiration Feature: Everyone Has a Price. You can see the glint in people’s hungry eyes as they watch money change hands and can perfectly name their price. As a bonus action you may spend your inspiration to accurately determine if a creature you see will take a bribe and what price they’ll accept. 

FULFILLING YOUR DESTINY
You fulfill your destiny of Wealth when you become obscenely wealthy.

Become the head of a large and successful business, amass at least 1,000,000 chits, obtain a legendary ~~magic~~ item, acquire a priceless treasure.

Fulfillment Feature: Wise Investments. The fabulously wealthy stay wealthy by creating businesses or investing wisely—then the engine of industry works tirelessly to keep the vaults full. You have a rich lifestyle (see lifestyle expenses).

In addition, living lavishly can be reinvigorating. You can lavish yourself and any number of other creatures with luxuries whenever you start a long rest at the cost of 100 chits per creature. Each creature lavished in this way is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage. A creature’s hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours.
