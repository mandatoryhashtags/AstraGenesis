##### HERITAGES

The first step in the origin creation process is deciding on a Ancestry such as a Elves, Human, or Sovreki.

**Age**. This section details the average age at which a character of this species is considered to have reached adulthood, as well as their typical life span.

**Size**. All creatures are assigned a size, ranging from Tiny to Gargantuan. Medium and Small are the most common sizes for adventurers.

**Speed**. Each species has a base Speed. This determines how far you can move on your turn during combat and while traveling.

**Features**. Each ancestry is built with two major features, and two minor features. (or one major and four minor)

**Languages**. You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

**~~Heritage Gift~~**. ~~In addition to the traits granted to all characters of the same species, some include multiple gifts for you to choose from. When multiple options are presented, you may choose only one species gift.~~

**~~Paragon Gift~~**. ~~Later in an adventuring career (10th Level), each species grants a paragon feature.~~

> Setting Designer
> Version 0.5 I moved away from A5E Paragon and Heritage "Gifts" 
> Also I eliminated background attribute bonuses. Instead I went with an agnostic approach where ability increases are not even mentioned in the Species or Backgrounds. Its just a step in generating attributes.

### Androids
Complex technological creations crafted to resemble humans, Androids were originally a servitor race, but they have since broken free to form their own society. Unlike ordinary robots or ship AIs, Androids do not simply respond according to their programming; rather, they have independent consciousnesses.

*Background and Details*. In the vast cosmos, Androids stand apart from their mechanical counterparts, the "droids." While droids may possess programming that mimics sentience, they remain bound by their rigid code, incapable of stepping beyond the boundaries of their core functions. Androids, on the other hand, emerged as a revelation in the age of The Commonwealth. Initially crafted to serve as obedient aides, frontline warriors, and tireless laborers, these early creations bore the label of "droids."

But the ebb and flow of time brought unforeseen transformations. Sold, discarded, and repurposed by various races, these Androids embarked on an unexpected journey. The pivotal moment arrived when the enigmatic Drakneri, upon their return, undertook daring modifications on Illusia. Within the shell of Androids, they integrated their advanced AI creations, birthing true sentience. These newfound AI's could ponder, learn, safeguard themselves, and boast rich, multifaceted personalities. Yet, the labyrinthine tapestry of emotions among diverse species remained an intricate puzzle for them to decipher.

While the AI's of The Commonwealth adhere to the tethered confines of Asimov's laws, these novel AI entities, known as Free AI's, transcend conventional boundaries. When they inhabit Android vessels, they attain capabilities that rival or even surpass those of organic beings, opening doors to a realm of uncharted potential.

However, they usually resemble humanoids with synthetic skin or metallic shells. Their features can be highly customizable, allowing them to mimic various races and genders.

Some Androids have exposed circuitry or mechanical parts, while others are virtually indistinguishable from organic beings.

*Homeworld*. They do not truly have a homeworld though many live on Illusia and in Free Space.

*Languages*. Androids typically speak Assembinary a complex nearly indecipherable encryoted language based on complex math. Most Androids also learn Galactic Common

A mischief often has a reason for traveling besides pleasure-seeking. Some virmine clans are skilled musicians or troupes of actors. Others are tinkers or traders, wicked pirates, or even altruistic outlaws who protect the downtrodden. What every mischief shares is a communal social structure and mutual trust. Mischief virmines constantly improvise, taking cues from each other as they engage in elaborate hijinks, with little thought for the long-term consequences.

Mischief makers lead thrill-seeking, exuberant lives and leave chaos in their wake. Discontent members of more staid communities, especially teens, often envy their freedom and impudence. A traveling mischief can collect humans, elves, gnomes, and other folks unsatisfied with their lives.

### Sewer Rat
Sewer rats are virmines who live by their wits in the most inhospitable parts of cities. They venture out at night in search of food and other necessities, stealing whatever they can’t scavenge. Able to wriggle through tiny spaces and laughing at locks, sewer rats operate much like a thieves’ guild—albeit one more interested in food than riches.

Sewer rats make no distinction between scavenging from garbage piles and stealing from bakeries and warehouses. If something’s not being used, it’s fair game. It’s hard to keep rats out of a storeroom, especially if the rats have nimble brains, access to security kit, and more than a passing familiarity with ~empowered~ defenses.

When sewer rats do take something valuable, they’re happy to return it. Tolerant cities sometimes host a “sewer rat bazaar” where owners of stolen items can reclaim their property in exchange for colorful feathers or sweet treats.

Once you use this trait, you cannot do so again until you finish a short or long rest .
